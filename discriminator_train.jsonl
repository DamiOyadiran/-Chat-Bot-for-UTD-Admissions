The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.\nAppeal Process\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the petition and will contact the student when a decision has been made. The decision of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee is final.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the Aid Appeals Committee?\n Related:","completion":" no"}
{"prompt":"maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the final decision of the Aid Appeals Committee?\n Related:","completion":" no"}
