It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What makes a great personal statement?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What should you do if you receive a scholarship from an outside donor?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is net cost?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based.

Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are the eligibility requirements for the spouse or child of the veteran?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How and when will my financial aid be disbursed?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods.

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the international student?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

{"prompt":"aid-programs exemptions-and-waivers foster-care 1\nVeteran Exemptions and Waivers\nVeteran Benefits Forms\n\nThe program purpose is to provide financial assistance to students who were in foster care when they turned 18 years of age. The exemption covers tuition and fees for courses for which the University receives tax support (i.e., a course that does not depend solely on student tuition and fees to cover its costs); however, once you have been determined eligible for the benefit, the benefit continues indefinitely. There are no durational limitations in statute referencing how many semesters or years a student may receive this exemption.\nIn order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:\n\nHave been under the conservatorship of the Department of Family and Protective Services at one of the following points in time:\n\nOn the day preceding your 18th birthday\nOn or after the day of your 14th birthday, if you were also eligible for adoption on or after that day\nOn the day you graduated from high school or received the equivalent of a high school diploma\nOn the day preceding:\n\nThe date you were adopted, if that date is on or after September 1, 2009\nThe date permanent managing conservatorship was awarded to a person other than your parent, if that date is on or after September 1, 2009\n\nDuring an academic term in which you were enrolled in a dual credit course or other course for which a high school student may earn joint high school and college credit\n\nEnroll in an institution of higher education as an undergraduate student or in a dual credit course or other course for which a high school student may earn joint high school and college credit no later than your 25th birthday.\n\nTo apply, provide the Office of Financial Aid with written proof of eligibility from the Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS).\nAssistance with locating temporary housing between academic terms (fall, spring and summer) is also available to eligible students who were in foster care on the day preceding their eighteenth birthday and who were enrolled full-time at a public institution in the previous term and are registered or committed to enrolling full-time at a public institution in the subsequent term.

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What must be included on the degree plan that service members submit to UT Dallas?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the email address that service members must check in order\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are the responsibilities of financial aid recipients at UT Dallas?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How many hours do you need to be enrolled in as an undergraduate student and graduate student for most institutional, state, and\/or loan aid to be disbursed?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: Who should contact the Texas Veterans Commission if they want more information about the Texas Hazlewood Act Exemption?\nAnswer:","completion":" No appropriate context found."}

This form is made available by the federal government on October 1 each year for school years that begin the following fall.\nThe FAFSA collects information regarding income, assets, household size, and the number of members of the household attending college. If you are an undergraduate who is younger than 24 years old, it is likely you will also need to provide information regarding your parents.\nThe FAFSA is processed by the federal government and the results are sent to schools you select on the form. Each school gets the same information. The family contribution calculated using this form is also the same at each school. What is different, depending on the school, is the cost of the program and often the financial aid funds available to meet your financial need.\nThe Office of Financial Aid determines your financial need by subtracting your expected family contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost to attend UT Dallas.
