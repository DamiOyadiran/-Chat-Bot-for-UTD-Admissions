When you submit a financial aid application to the Office of Financial Aid, you are seeking help with funding your educational expenses. Some forms of funding do not have to be repaid, while student loans require repayment with interest, and work-study requires employment. Exemptions, waivers, and veterans benefits each have application processes outside of the general financial aid application process. The types of aid programs are listed below with more information.
Grants
Grants do not have to be repaid and are usually awarded based on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), as calculated using the data on your financial aid application, and your financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at The University of Texas at Dallas.
Student Loans
Student loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans and private loans.
Work-Study
Work-study is a form of financial aid that allows you to work, usually in an on-campus position, to earn the funding offered to you by the Office of Financial Aid. Work-study requires that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas. The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.
Exemptions and Waivers
Exemptions
Exemption programs provide funding that effectively exempt you from having to pay a portion or all of your tuition or, in some cases, your tuition and fees. Exemption programs are available for certain eligible students who are classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.
Waivers
Waiver programs are designed to waive the out-of-state portion of your non-resident tuition. Waiver programs are available for certain eligible students who are not classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.
Veterans Benefits
Veterans Benefits include federal and state funding programs for eligible veterans and service members and, in some cases, their spouses and dependents. Possible funding ranges from tuition and housing assistance to living allowances.

Texas is one of sixteen states participating in the Academic Common Market (ACM), an interstate agreement for sharing state-supported graduate programs. Residents of member states who are accepted for admission into selected out-of-state graduate programs may enroll on an in-state rather than out-of-state tuition basis. Programs are selected by the states annually. Information about UT Dallas graduate programs selected for the ACM by other states is available from the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies.
For residents of Texas looking to study out-of-state, the first step is to confirm that a comparable program at the same graduate degree level is not being offered at a Texas public university. For a listing of these programs, or for more information, visit the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Degree Board Program Search web site or email the ACM Coordinator or call at 512-427-6518. A number of programs are available at in-state tuition rates (those in-state rates applicable to the out-of-state where the graduate program is offered).

For Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized loans, repayment generally starts after a 6-month grace period that begins the day after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time status. Unless otherwise notified by your servicer, your first monthly payment will be due after your grace period ends. For PLUS loans, repayment begins once the loan has fully disbursed, but students and parents may be eligible for an in-school deferment; contact the loan servicer for more information.
You will be making your loan payments to your federal loan servicer, the company that handles the billing and other services on your federal student loan. You can find out who your servicer is and locate their contact information by logging into the Federal Student Aid website.
If you have trouble repaying your loans, you should contact your servicer as soon as possible. They can work with you to find the best option for your situation, including changing your repayment plan or requesting a deferment or forbearance. Deferment and forbearance may allow you to temporarily stop making or reduce your loan payments.
The following resources are good sources for information on repaying your federal student loans:

Exit Counseling – Completing a Direct Loan Exit Counseling session is required before you graduate, withdraw, or cease attending half-time. The session provides basic information on repaying your loans and informs you of your rights and responsibilities as a student loan borrower.
Your Servicer – Maintaining contact with your federal loan servicer is essential throughout the repayment process and they can help with many of the details of repaying your loans. They are also your contact point if you should have trouble repaying your loans.
StudentAid.gov – The “My Aid” summary, accessed by logging into Federal Student Aid, provides detail on what kind of loans you have borrowed, the amounts of those loans, and provides you with your loan servicer’s name and contact information. You can also find a variety of resources, including a repayment estimator and answers to many frequently asked questions about repayment on the Manage Loans section of the Federal Student Aid website.

Perkins Loan Repayment
The grace period for Perkins loans is 9 months and the first payment will be due at the end of the grace period. Before you graduate, withdraw, or drop below half-time, you must arrange for an exit interview by calling 972-883-2296 or by contacting the loan servicer, Campus Partners, at 1-800-334-8609.

It is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan. Private loans are usually more expensive than federal loans, so you and your family should consider obtaining a private loan only after exhausting your federal loan eligibility, including Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS Loans. Learn more information about the two options at the Federal Versus Private Loans website. You can also learn about the maximum amounts of federal aid that you may be eligible to receive by visiting the Federal Loans page.

66,aid-programs,aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq 1,"What type of benefit am I eligible for?
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs determines eligibility for benefits; UT Dallas cannot make this determination. To apply, visit www.gibill.va.gov. In the ‘How do I apply?’ section, click the green, ‘Find your education benefits form’ button. Answer the questions on the screen. Click the green ‘Apply now’ button to fill out your application for benefits online.
Typical processing time by the VA is 30 days, after which a certificate of eligibility will be mailed to you providing information regarding your eligibility/ineligibility.

I know I’m eligible for a specific benefit, but how do I get certified?
Please follow the steps listed on the individual pages for each benefit type (on the sidebar to the left of the screen).

Does UT Dallas participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program?
No. The Yellow Ribbon Program allows schools to enter into an agreement with VA to fund the tuition and fees that exceed the basic amounts payable by the VA. This is typically needed for students who are charged out-of-state tuition and fees. However, UT Dallas has several waivers that cancel the out-of-state portion. For more information about these, please visit our Exemptions and Waivers page.

How long does it take to receive my benefits once I’ve been certified?
Generally, most paperwork submitted to our office is processed within 3-5 business days. After the certification is sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs, it takes an additional 30 days to process your certification and release the funds. If you are using your benefits for the first time, the expected processing time is typically longer for the VA. As a final note, VA processing times can increase greatly during the beginning of the term, so these timelines are only estimates.

Who do I contact if I haven’t received my monthly stipend or housing/book allowance?
If you have received an email from our office notifying you that you have been certified, and it has been more than 30 days, you will need to reach out to the VA directly (888-GIBILL-1). Please note, the VA releases housing stipends for training that occurred the previous month. For example, if the first day of classes begins in August, the earliest a housing stipend would be released is the first of September. Additionally, the VA pro-rates payments for the number of days in the month that a student is enrolled. For example, if the first day of classes is Aug. 25, the VA will pay for only a pro-rated number of days and the housing stipend will be less.
Finally, for book stipends, the VA will not release these funds prior to 14 days before the term starts.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits and still have a balance due to the Bursar’s Office. When will my tuition and fees be paid?
When initially certifying students using Chapter 33 benefits, our office certifies students’ enrolled semester credit hours without a tuition and fees amount – meaning these certifications will be submitted with a $0 amount. After Census Day each term, our office will update certifications to include students’ actual tuition and fees charges. Students will initially receive a letter from the VA that their enrollment has been certified at $0; processing in this way allows the VA to still release housing and book stipends to eligible students.
Again, this process will not prevent students from receiving housing and/or book stipends for which they are eligible. Payment from the VA will arrive after Census Day when certifications are updated to include tuition and fees. This typically takes 2-4 weeks after Census Day. Students will continue to see a balance due on their account while we wait for the VA to send tuition and fee payments to UTD. All students using Chapter 33 benefits, who have turned in an initial certificate of eligibility (COE), will have a “VA Benefit Recipient” hold placed on their account that prevents them from being dropped and late fees from accruing.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits. Can I have my financial aid released to me before the VA sends payment?
Yes. Our office will require you to submit a copy of either your VA Award Letter (for the current term) or a printout of your Statement of Benefits from the VA.GOV website (including the Enrollment History section). Please note, you should only submit this document after you have received notification from our office that you have been certified, and the VA alerts you that your certification has been processed.  We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.

Are there any fees that the VA will not cover?
Yes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 – Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?
If you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.

How many hours constitute what pay rate?
The following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:
Undergraduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432
Graduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321
If you are using Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.  For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at www.gibill.va.gov/.

Can I repeat a course?
If you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.  However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a “W,” you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the Academic Calendar for these dates. For further information please contact the VA – 888-GIBILL-1.

How far back can I be certified?
The VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.

What if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?
Courses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

Can I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?
Yes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.  In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.  You can submit these via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?
Once you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.

Do I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?
Yes. You must fill out the online certification form. Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

How can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?
You may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).  If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9/11), you may also use the ebenefits website.

Am I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and/or spouse?
Contact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

How can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?
You may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).  If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9/11), you may also use the ebenefits website.

Am I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and/or spouse?
Contact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

Finally, for book stipends, the VA will not release these funds prior to 14 days before the term starts.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits and still have a balance due to the Bursar’s Office. When will my tuition and fees be paid?
When initially certifying students using Chapter 33 benefits, our office certifies students’ enrolled semester credit hours without a tuition and fees amount – meaning these certifications will be submitted with a $0 amount. After Census Day each term, our office will update certifications to include students’ actual tuition and fees charges. Students will initially receive a letter from the VA that their enrollment has been certified at $0; processing in this way allows the VA to still release housing and book stipends to eligible students.
Again, this process will not prevent students from receiving housing and/or book stipends for which they are eligible. Payment from the VA will arrive after Census Day when certifications are updated to include tuition and fees. This typically takes 2-4 weeks after Census Day. Students will continue to see a balance due on their account while we wait for the VA to send tuition and fee payments to UTD. All students using Chapter 33 benefits, who have turned in an initial certificate of eligibility (COE), will have a “VA Benefit Recipient” hold placed on their account that prevents them from being dropped and late fees from accruing.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits. Can I have my financial aid released to me before the VA sends payment?
Yes. Our office will require you to submit a copy of either your VA Award Letter (for the current term) or a printout of your Statement of Benefits from the VA.GOV website (including the Enrollment History section). Please note, you should only submit this document after you have received notification from our office that you have been certified, and the VA alerts you that your certification has been processed.  We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.

Are there any fees that the VA will not cover?
Yes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 – Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?
If you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.

How many hours constitute what pay rate?
The following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:
Undergraduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432
Graduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321
If you are using Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.  For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at www.gibill.va.gov/.

Can I repeat a course?
If you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.  However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a “W,” you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the Academic Calendar for these dates. For further information please contact the VA – 888-GIBILL-1.

How far back can I be certified?
The VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.

What if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?
Courses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

Can I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?
Yes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.  In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.  You can submit these via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?
Once you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.

Do I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?

Please review the Academic Calendar for these dates. For further information please contact the VA – 888-GIBILL-1.

How far back can I be certified?
The VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.

What if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?
Courses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

Can I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?
Yes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.  In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.  You can submit these via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?
Once you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.

Do I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?
Yes. You must fill out the online certification form. Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

How can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?
You may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).  If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9/11), you may also use the ebenefits website.

Am I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and/or spouse?
Contact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

 be retaken.  However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

71,aid-programs,aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq #va-ro 1,"What type of benefit am I eligible for?
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs determines eligibility for benefits; UT Dallas cannot make this determination. To apply, visit www.gibill.va.gov. In the ‘How do I apply?’ section, click the green, ‘Find your education benefits form’ button. Answer the questions on the screen. Click the green ‘Apply now’ button to fill out your application for benefits online.
Typical processing time by the VA is 30 days, after which a certificate of eligibility will be mailed to you providing information regarding your eligibility/ineligibility.

I know I’m eligible for a specific benefit, but how do I get certified?
Please follow the steps listed on the individual pages for each benefit type (on the sidebar to the left of the screen).

Does UT Dallas participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program?
No. The Yellow Ribbon Program allows schools to enter into an agreement with VA to fund the tuition and fees that exceed the basic amounts payable by the VA. This is typically needed for students who are charged out-of-state tuition and fees. However, UT Dallas has several waivers that cancel the out-of-state portion. For more information about these, please visit our Exemptions and Waivers page.

How long does it take to receive my benefits once I’ve been certified?
Generally, most paperwork submitted to our office is processed within 3-5 business days. After the certification is sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs, it takes an additional 30 days to process your certification and release the funds. If you are using your benefits for the first time, the expected processing time is typically longer for the VA. As a final note, VA processing times can increase greatly during the beginning of the term, so these timelines are only estimates.

Who do I contact if I haven’t received my monthly stipend or housing/book allowance?
If you have received an email from our office notifying you that you have been certified, and it has been more than 30 days, you will need to reach out to the VA directly (888-GIBILL-1). Please note, the VA releases housing stipends for training that occurred the previous month. For example, if the first day of classes begins in August, the earliest a housing stipend would be released is the first of September. Additionally, the VA pro-rates payments for the number of days in the month that a student is enrolled. For example, if the first day of classes is Aug. 25, the VA will pay for only a pro-rated number of days and the housing stipend will be less.
Finally, for book stipends, the VA will not release these funds prior to 14 days before the term starts.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits and still have a balance due to the Bursar’s Office. When will my tuition and fees be paid?
When initially certifying students using Chapter 33 benefits, our office certifies students’ enrolled semester credit hours without a tuition and fees amount – meaning these certifications will be submitted with a $0 amount. After Census Day each term, our office will update certifications to include students’ actual tuition and fees charges. Students will initially receive a letter from the VA that their enrollment has been certified at $0; processing in this way allows the VA to still release housing and book stipends to eligible students.
Again, this process will not prevent students from receiving housing and/or book stipends for which they are eligible. Payment from the VA will arrive after Census Day when certifications are updated to include tuition and fees. This typically takes 2-4 weeks after Census Day. Students will continue to see a balance due on their account while we wait for the VA to send tuition and fee payments to UTD. All students using Chapter 33 benefits, who have turned in an initial certificate of eligibility (COE), will have a “VA Benefit Recipient” hold placed on their account that prevents them from being dropped and late fees from accruing.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits. Can I have my financial aid released to me before the VA sends payment?
Yes. Our office will require you to submit a copy of either your VA Award Letter (for the current term) or a printout of your Statement of Benefits from the VA.GOV website (including the Enrollment History section). Please note, you should only submit this document after you have received notification from our office that you have been certified, and the VA alerts you that your certification has been processed.  We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.

Are there any fees that the VA will not cover?
Yes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 – Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?
If you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.

How many hours constitute what pay rate?
The following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:
Undergraduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432
Graduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321
If you are using Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.  For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at www.gibill.va.gov/.

Can I repeat a course?
If you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.  However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a “W,” you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA.

If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

I want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?
Once you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.

Do I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?
Yes. You must fill out the online certification form. Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

How can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?
You may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).  If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9/11), you may also use the ebenefits website.

Am I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and/or spouse?
Contact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

Finally, for book stipends, the VA will not release these funds prior to 14 days before the term starts.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits and still have a balance due to the Bursar’s Office. When will my tuition and fees be paid?
When initially certifying students using Chapter 33 benefits, our office certifies students’ enrolled semester credit hours without a tuition and fees amount – meaning these certifications will be submitted with a $0 amount. After Census Day each term, our office will update certifications to include students’ actual tuition and fees charges. Students will initially receive a letter from the VA that their enrollment has been certified at $0; processing in this way allows the VA to still release housing and book stipends to eligible students.
Again, this process will not prevent students from receiving housing and/or book stipends for which they are eligible. Payment from the VA will arrive after Census Day when certifications are updated to include tuition and fees. This typically takes 2-4 weeks after Census Day. Students will continue to see a balance due on their account while we wait for the VA to send tuition and fee payments to UTD. All students using Chapter 33 benefits, who have turned in an initial certificate of eligibility (COE), will have a “VA Benefit Recipient” hold placed on their account that prevents them from being dropped and late fees from accruing.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits. Can I have my financial aid released to me before the VA sends payment?
Yes. Our office will require you to submit a copy of either your VA Award Letter (for the current term) or a printout of your Statement of Benefits from the VA.GOV website (including the Enrollment History section). Please note, you should only submit this document after you have received notification from our office that you have been certified, and the VA alerts you that your certification has been processed.  We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.

Are there any fees that the VA will not cover?
Yes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 – Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?
If you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.

How many hours constitute what pay rate?
The following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:
Undergraduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432
Graduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321
If you are using Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.  For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at www.gibill.va.gov/.

Can I repeat a course?
If you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.  However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a “W,” you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the Academic Calendar for these dates. For further information please contact the VA – 888-GIBILL-1.

How far back can I be certified?
The VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.

What if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?
Courses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

Can I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?
Yes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.  In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.  You can submit these via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a “W,” you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the Academic Calendar for these dates. For further information please contact the VA – 888-GIBILL-1.

How far back can I be certified?
The VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.

What if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?
Courses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

Can I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?
Yes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.  In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.  You can submit these via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?
Once you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.

Do I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?
Yes. You must fill out the online certification form. Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

How can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?
You may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).  If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9/11), you may also use the ebenefits website.

Am I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and/or spouse?
Contact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

The priority deadline for submitting all required documentation is July 15 for the upcoming academic year. If we have received all required forms by the priority deadline, the exemption will be in place before the Full Term Census Day as noted in the Academic Calendar. We continue to process late applications in the order they are received. However, applicants who submit documentation after the start of the term are strongly encouraged to consider making alternate payment arrangements with the Bursar’s Office in order to meet the payment deadline. Late submission of documents may result in late fees and/or cancelled enrollment. Applications and all supporting documentation may be submitted no later than the last day of class for any given term. Hazlewood is not retroactive to prior terms.

Is there a minimum academic requirement?
All undergraduate and graduate Hazlewood recipients (Veteran, Legacy, and Dependent of 100% Disabled Veteran) must meet cumulative GPA requirements as defined by the Office of Financial Aid. Additionally, undergraduate students must not have completed a number of semester credit hours that is considered to be excessive as outlined in Texas Education Code 54.014. Legacy Act students must be enrolled in a degree program and may not exempt more than the degree plan maximum hours. Hazlewood Exemption benefits will not be processed for subsequent terms until the previous term’s academic progress has been reviewed and continuing program eligibility has been verified.
The above GPA requirements are not applicable to the children and spouses of a MIA, KIA, or service-connected deceased Veteran.

How many hours do I need to enroll in to receive the Hazlewood Exemption?
There is no minimum course load required to receive the Hazlewood Exemption; however, if you are eligible, there are minimum requirements for both financial aid and federal VA benefits.

What happens if I decide to drop or withdraw from a course while receiving the Hazlewood Exemption?
If you drop a course before Census Day but remain enrolled in at least one other course, the hours related to the dropped course will not be charged toward your Hazlewood eligibility. However, if you drop or withdraw from a course(s) after Census Day, the hours related to the course(s) dropped will be deducted from your Hazlewood eligibility. If you withdraw from all courses after the final day to receive a 100% refund, you will be charged Hazlewood hours based on the Payment & Refund Calendar.
Please note, dropping or withdrawing from a course may also affect your eligibility for financial aid and/or federal VA benefits.

Is there an age limit for the Hazlewood Exemption?
In order to maintain eligibility for the Legacy Program under the Hazlewood Exemption, a student must be 25 years or younger on the first day of the term for which the exemption is claimed (unless granted an extension due to a qualifying illness or debilitating condition). There is no age limit for a veteran or for the spouse or child of a veteran who was 100% disabled or deceased as a result of service-related injury or illness.

Are any programs excluded from the Hazlewood Exemption at UT Dallas?
Executive education and certain certificate programs are not eligible for the Hazlewood exemption for the reason that the school does not receive state formula funding (tax support) for these programs.

What is a Certificate of Eligibility for Federal GI Bill benefits (COE) and how do I get one?
A Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is an official correspondence from the VA stating your federal education benefits status. The certificate will state whether you have exhausted your eligibility for GI Bill benefits (Chapters 31, 33 [Post-9/11]). COE’s may be obtained by completing a Online GI Bill® Application or by calling 1-888-GI-Bill-1.

I used the Hazlewood Exemption at another school. Do I need to complete another application?
Yes. State law requires all schools to maintain their own Hazlewood exemption records. Each school also is required to verify your attempted Hazlewood hours from all previously attended institutions.

Can I receive both Hazlewood and VA Benefits?
A student may use Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) or Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation) with Hazlewood during the same term if the combination of benefits does not exceed the total amount of tuition and fees. In either case, Hazlewood benefits may cover eligible tuition and fees that are not covered by Ch. 33 or Ch. 31 tuition and fees payments. A student may receive the full amount of federal education benefits issued under Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB, Chapter 30 & Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Post Vietnam Era Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32) in conjunction with Hazlewood.

Can I receive both Hazlewood and other forms of financial aid?
While the Hazlewood exemption may be used in conjunction with some other forms of financial aid, such as federal grants, outside scholarships, loans, and work-study, it must fit within your Cost of Attendance (COA) and contribute to your financial need, if applicable. Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only. Consequently, those funds may not be received in addition to the Hazlewood Exemption. If financial aid is already disbursed or awarded at the time your Hazlewood exemption is approved, adjustments may be made to your financial aid to allow for the exemption. Additionally, exemption amounts will be adjusted to allow for any federal VA education (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits that are received.

Where can I find veteran services other than Hazlewood at the university?
UT Dallas provides a full service Military and Veteran Center with resources for veterans, reservists, eligible dependents, and active duty military students.

Applications and all supporting documentation may be submitted no later than the last day of class for any given term. Hazlewood is not retroactive to prior terms.

Is there a minimum academic requirement?
All undergraduate and graduate Hazlewood recipients (Veteran, Legacy, and Dependent of 100% Disabled Veteran) must meet cumulative GPA requirements as defined by the Office of Financial Aid. Additionally, undergraduate students must not have completed a number of semester credit hours that is considered to be excessive as outlined in Texas Education Code 54.014. Legacy Act students must be enrolled in a degree program and may not exempt more than the degree plan maximum hours. Hazlewood Exemption benefits will not be processed for subsequent terms until the previous term’s academic progress has been reviewed and continuing program eligibility has been verified.
The above GPA requirements are not applicable to the children and spouses of a MIA, KIA, or service-connected deceased Veteran.

How many hours do I need to enroll in to receive the Hazlewood Exemption?
There is no minimum course load required to receive the Hazlewood Exemption; however, if you are eligible, there are minimum requirements for both financial aid and federal VA benefits.

What happens if I decide to drop or withdraw from a course while receiving the Hazlewood Exemption?
If you drop a course before Census Day but remain enrolled in at least one other course, the hours related to the dropped course will not be charged toward your Hazlewood eligibility. However, if you drop or withdraw from a course(s) after Census Day, the hours related to the course(s) dropped will be deducted from your Hazlewood eligibility. If you withdraw from all courses after the final day to receive a 100% refund, you will be charged Hazlewood hours based on the Payment & Refund Calendar.
Please note, dropping or withdrawing from a course may also affect your eligibility for financial aid and/or federal VA benefits.

Is there an age limit for the Hazlewood Exemption?
In order to maintain eligibility for the Legacy Program under the Hazlewood Exemption, a student must be 25 years or younger on the first day of the term for which the exemption is claimed (unless granted an extension due to a qualifying illness or debilitating condition). There is no age limit for a veteran or for the spouse or child of a veteran who was 100% disabled or deceased as a result of service-related injury or illness.

Are any programs excluded from the Hazlewood Exemption at UT Dallas?
Executive education and certain certificate programs are not eligible for the Hazlewood exemption for the reason that the school does not receive state formula funding (tax support) for these programs.

What is a Certificate of Eligibility for Federal GI Bill benefits (COE) and how do I get one?
A Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is an official correspondence from the VA stating your federal education benefits status. The certificate will state whether you have exhausted your eligibility for GI Bill benefits (Chapters 31, 33 [Post-9/11]). COE’s may be obtained by completing a Online GI Bill® Application or by calling 1-888-GI-Bill-1.

I used the Hazlewood Exemption at another school. Do I need to complete another application?
Yes. State law requires all schools to maintain their own Hazlewood exemption records. Each school also is required to verify your attempted Hazlewood hours from all previously attended institutions.

Can I receive both Hazlewood and VA Benefits?
A student may use Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) or Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation) with Hazlewood during the same term if the combination of benefits does not exceed the total amount of tuition and fees. In either case, Hazlewood benefits may cover eligible tuition and fees that are not covered by Ch. 33 or Ch. 31 tuition and fees payments. A student may receive the full amount of federal education benefits issued under Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB, Chapter 30 & Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Post Vietnam Era Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32) in conjunction with Hazlewood.

Can I receive both Hazlewood and other forms of financial aid?
While the Hazlewood exemption may be used in conjunction with some other forms of financial aid, such as federal grants, outside scholarships, loans, and work-study, it must fit within your Cost of Attendance (COA) and contribute to your financial need, if applicable. Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only. Consequently, those funds may not be received in addition to the Hazlewood Exemption. If financial aid is already disbursed or awarded at the time your Hazlewood exemption is approved, adjustments may be made to your financial aid to allow for the exemption. Additionally, exemption amounts will be adjusted to allow for any federal VA education (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits that are received.

Where can I find veteran services other than Hazlewood at the university?
UT Dallas provides a full service Military and Veteran Center with resources for veterans, reservists, eligible dependents, and active duty military students.

What type of benefit am I eligible for?
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs determines eligibility for benefits; UT Dallas cannot make this determination. To apply, visit www.gibill.va.gov. In the ‘How do I apply?’ section, click the green, ‘Find your education benefits form’ button. Answer the questions on the screen. Click the green ‘Apply now’ button to fill out your application for benefits online.
Typical processing time by the VA is 30 days, after which a certificate of eligibility will be mailed to you providing information regarding your eligibility/ineligibility.

I know I’m eligible for a specific benefit, but how do I get certified?
Please follow the steps listed on the individual pages for each benefit type (on the sidebar to the left of the screen).

Does UT Dallas participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program?
No. The Yellow Ribbon Program allows schools to enter into an agreement with VA to fund the tuition and fees that exceed the basic amounts payable by the VA. This is typically needed for students who are charged out-of-state tuition and fees. However, UT Dallas has several waivers that cancel the out-of-state portion. For more information about these, please visit our Exemptions and Waivers page.

How long does it take to receive my benefits once I’ve been certified?
Generally, most paperwork submitted to our office is processed within 3-5 business days. After the certification is sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs, it takes an additional 30 days to process your certification and release the funds. If you are using your benefits for the first time, the expected processing time is typically longer for the VA. As a final note, VA processing times can increase greatly during the beginning of the term, so these timelines are only estimates.

Who do I contact if I haven’t received my monthly stipend or housing/book allowance?
If you have received an email from our office notifying you that you have been certified, and it has been more than 30 days, you will need to reach out to the VA directly (888-GIBILL-1). Please note, the VA releases housing stipends for training that occurred the previous month. For example, if the first day of classes begins in August, the earliest a housing stipend would be released is the first of September. Additionally, the VA pro-rates payments for the number of days in the month that a student is enrolled. For example, if the first day of classes is Aug. 25, the VA will pay for only a pro-rated number of days and the housing stipend will be less.
Finally, for book stipends, the VA will not release these funds prior to 14 days before the term starts.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits and still have a balance due to the Bursar’s Office. When will my tuition and fees be paid?
When initially certifying students using Chapter 33 benefits, our office certifies students’ enrolled semester credit hours without a tuition and fees amount – meaning these certifications will be submitted with a $0 amount. After Census Day each term, our office will update certifications to include students’ actual tuition and fees charges. Students will initially receive a letter from the VA that their enrollment has been certified at $0; processing in this way allows the VA to still release housing and book stipends to eligible students.
Again, this process will not prevent students from receiving housing and/or book stipends for which they are eligible. Payment from the VA will arrive after Census Day when certifications are updated to include tuition and fees. This typically takes 2-4 weeks after Census Day. Students will continue to see a balance due on their account while we wait for the VA to send tuition and fee payments to UTD. All students using Chapter 33 benefits, who have turned in an initial certificate of eligibility (COE), will have a “VA Benefit Recipient” hold placed on their account that prevents them from being dropped and late fees from accruing.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits. Can I have my financial aid released to me before the VA sends payment?
Yes. Our office will require you to submit a copy of either your VA Award Letter (for the current term) or a printout of your Statement of Benefits from the VA.GOV website (including the Enrollment History section). Please note, you should only submit this document after you have received notification from our office that you have been certified, and the VA alerts you that your certification has been processed.  We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.

Are there any fees that the VA will not cover?
Yes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 – Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?
If you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.

How many hours constitute what pay rate?
The following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:
Undergraduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432
Graduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321
If you are using Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.  For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at www.gibill.va.gov/.

Can I repeat a course?
If you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.  However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a “W,” you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the Academic Calendar for these dates. For further information please contact the VA – 888-GIBILL-1.

How far back can I be certified?
The VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.

What if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?
Courses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

Can I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?
Yes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.  In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.  You can submit these via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?
Once you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.

Do I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?
Yes. You must fill out the online certification form. Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

How can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?
You may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).  If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9/11), you may also use the ebenefits website.

Am I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and/or spouse?
Contact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits and still have a balance due to the Bursar’s Office. When will my tuition and fees be paid?
When initially certifying students using Chapter 33 benefits, our office certifies students’ enrolled semester credit hours without a tuition and fees amount – meaning these certifications will be submitted with a $0 amount. After Census Day each term, our office will update certifications to include students’ actual tuition and fees charges. Students will initially receive a letter from the VA that their enrollment has been certified at $0; processing in this way allows the VA to still release housing and book stipends to eligible students.
Again, this process will not prevent students from receiving housing and/or book stipends for which they are eligible. Payment from the VA will arrive after Census Day when certifications are updated to include tuition and fees. This typically takes 2-4 weeks after Census Day. Students will continue to see a balance due on their account while we wait for the VA to send tuition and fee payments to UTD. All students using Chapter 33 benefits, who have turned in an initial certificate of eligibility (COE), will have a “VA Benefit Recipient” hold placed on their account that prevents them from being dropped and late fees from accruing.

I am using Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Chapter 33) benefits. Can I have my financial aid released to me before the VA sends payment?
Yes. Our office will require you to submit a copy of either your VA Award Letter (for the current term) or a printout of your Statement of Benefits from the VA.GOV website (including the Enrollment History section). Please note, you should only submit this document after you have received notification from our office that you have been certified, and the VA alerts you that your certification has been processed.  We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.

Are there any fees that the VA will not cover?
Yes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 – Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?
If you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill®) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.

How many hours constitute what pay rate?
The following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:
Undergraduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432
Graduate HoursFull Time3/4 Time1/2 TimeFall/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321
If you are using Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.  For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at www.gibill.va.gov/.

Can I repeat a course?
If you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.  However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.

What if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?
If you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA. If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.

What happens if I decide to drop a class?
You must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a “W,” you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the Academic Calendar for these dates. For further information please contact the VA – 888-GIBILL-1.

How far back can I be certified?
The VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.

What if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?
Courses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.  For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.

Can I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?
Yes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.  In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.  You can submit these via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.

I want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?
Once you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.

Do I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?
Yes. You must fill out the online certification form. Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

How can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?
You may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).  If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9/11), you may also use the ebenefits website.

Am I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and/or spouse?
Contact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

Only Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty. There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.

Can I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?
It depends. If you are receiving Post 9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you are not eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously. However, you can typically apply for the Hazlewood Exemption if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.

Yes. You must fill out the online certification form. Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.

Grade Point Average (GPA)

The minimum cumulative GPA requirement for undergraduate students is 2.0.
The minimum cumulative GPA requirement for graduate students is 3.0.

Maximum Time Frame

The undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.
The graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.

Completion Rate
Students must successfully complete a percentage of all attempted hours that is in line with completing their degree requirements within the overall maximum time frame for a degree program. This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student’s overall successfully completed hours by the student’s overall attempted hours.
The undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.
Undergraduate Pace Rate:
Attempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%
The graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.
Incompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.
Transfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student’s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student’s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.
Repeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student’s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student’s cumulative GPA.
Students must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.

In these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students’ UT Dallas email address.
Student records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid. 
Students on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.  A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.  A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.

108,maintaining-aid,maintaining-aid satisfactory-academic-progress 1,"To be eligible for financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on a qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (completion rate/maximum timeframe) standard. 
Grade Point Average (GPA)

The minimum cumulative GPA requirement for undergraduate students is 2.0.
The minimum cumulative GPA requirement for graduate students is 3.0.

Maximum Time Frame

The undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.
The graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.

Completion Rate
Students must successfully complete a percentage of all attempted hours that is in line with completing their degree requirements within the overall maximum time frame for a degree program. This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student’s overall successfully completed hours by the student’s overall attempted hours.
The undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.
Undergraduate Pace Rate:
Attempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%
The graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.
Incompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.
Transfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student’s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student’s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.
Repeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student’s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student’s cumulative GPA.
Students must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.
Failure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards
In these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students’ UT Dallas email address.
Student records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid. 
Students on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.  A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.  A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.
Please note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state’s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.
Appeal Process
Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the petition and will contact the student when a decision has been made. The decision of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee is final.

111,maintaining-aid,maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1,"Students who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester
If you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University’s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar’s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.
The federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.
A calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.
In order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)
The Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually “earned” and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student’s date of withdrawal from all classes.
How the calculation works:

Number of days attended ÷ Days in semester = percent of semester completed
Total $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $
Total $ disbursed – Earned $ = $ to be returned

Students who drop courses but still are enrolled
Each federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.
Adjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.
Students who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.
Students who fail all courses
If you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.
Other information regarding withdrawing from classes
These regulations are not the same as the University’s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester’s Academic Calendar.

Information regarding the process of refunding financial aid to students and parents can be found at Bursar Office – Refunds.
Most financial aid programs are disbursed to your student account in the Bursar’s Office. The Bursar will apply the funds to pay UT Dallas charges first (tuition, fees, housing and meal plan). After those charges are paid, any remaining funds will be sent to you in the form of a refund.
We begin disbursing financial aid on or near the first day of the term. The disbursement of your financial aid could be delayed due to one of the following reasons:

Your current enrollment status does not match the enrollment status we used to award your financial aid.

Your original financial aid offer letter or email included the enrollment status we used to award your financial aid. If your enrollment status for the term does not match this enrollment status, please submit an Hours Adjustment Form.

You are not meeting the financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements.

Your SAP status was determined at the end of your last term enrolled at UT Dallas. Students placed on financial aid suspension are notified via their UTD email.

You have an outstanding financial aid To Do List item in Orion.

Required financial aid documents will appear in your To Do List in Orion.  The Office of Financial Aid also sends To Do List reminders to your UTD email.

You can check to see if your financial aid has been disbursed at EZPay.
You should sign up for direct deposit via EZPay. When a refund from your student account is available, it will be deposited to the bank account you have provided. If you do not sign up for direct deposit, the refund will be issued via paper check, which is mailed to your (the student’s) address on file. If you are receiving funds from a parent PLUS loan, the refund will be sent by paper check to the parent borrowing the loan.
If you need your anticipated refund of financial aid funds to pay for books and supplies, it is possible to obtain a book voucher from us. More information regarding the book voucher.
If you are on warning or probation with the Office of Financial Aid in regards to your academic progress, the disbursement of your financial aid may be delayed until your grades from the previous term have been evaluated.
The financial aid award notice we send you contains information regarding your anticipated enrollment. For example, it indicates if the financial aid awarded is based on your enrollment as a full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, or less than half-time student. If your actual enrollment is different from how your financial aid was awarded, the funds will not be released to the Bursar’s Office.

To check the status of a refund, please see Bursar Office – Refunds
Information regarding the process of refunding financial aid to students and parents can be found at Bursar Office – Refunds.
Most financial aid programs are disbursed to your student account in the Bursar’s Office. The Bursar will apply the funds to pay UT Dallas charges first (tuition, fees, housing and meal plan). After those charges are paid, any remaining funds will be sent to you in the form of a refund.
We begin disbursing financial aid on or near the first day of the term. The disbursement of your financial aid could be delayed due to one of the following reasons:

Your current enrollment status does not match the enrollment status we used to award your financial aid.

Your original financial aid offer letter or email included the enrollment status we used to award your financial aid. If your enrollment status for the term does not match this enrollment status, please submit an Hours Adjustment Form.

You are not meeting the financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements.

Your SAP status was determined at the end of your last term enrolled at UT Dallas. Students placed on financial aid suspension are notified via their UTD email.

You have an outstanding financial aid To Do List item in Orion.

Required financial aid documents will appear in your To Do List in Orion.  The Office of Financial Aid also sends To Do List reminders to your UTD email.

You can check to see if your financial aid has been disbursed at EZPay.
You should sign up for direct deposit via EZPay. When a refund from your student account is available, it will be deposited to the bank account you have provided. If you do not sign up for direct deposit, the refund will be issued via paper check, which is mailed to your (the student’s) address on file. If you are receiving funds from a parent PLUS loan, the refund will be sent by paper check to the parent borrowing the loan.
If you need your anticipated refund of financial aid funds to pay for books and supplies, it is possible to obtain a book voucher from us. More information regarding the book voucher.
If you are on warning or probation with the Office of Financial Aid in regards to your academic progress, the disbursement of your financial aid may be delayed until your grades from the previous term have been evaluated.
The financial aid award notice we send you contains information regarding your anticipated enrollment. For example, it indicates if the financial aid awarded is based on your enrollment as a full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, or less than half-time student. If your actual enrollment is different from how your financial aid was awarded, the funds will not be released to the Bursar’s Office. You can review the award notice we sent you in Orion under “communications”. You can request that we adjust your aid for your planned enrollment by completing the Hours Adjustment Form found on our forms page.

122,receiving-aid,receiving-aid faq 1,"What is UT Dallas’ FAFSA school code?
Our school code is 009741.

Do I have to complete a new FAFSA every year?
Yes. Please visit the Deadlines page for priority deadline information.

Do I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid?
You may complete a FAFSA at any time; however, we cannot process an award until you are officially admitted to UT Dallas.

May I transfer my financial aid from my old school to UT Dallas?
While your financial aid awards (grants, loans, etc.) do not transfer from one school to another, almost all schools in the United States use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as the application for financial aid.  You can visit studentaid.gov and correct your FAFSA to include UT Dallas (school code 009741). UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.

Can I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?
A: Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.

Do you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?
Students should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.

How do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?
You must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.

My parents don’t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?
The law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA’s topic on Dependency Status.

My parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?
There is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the “Will Not File” option. They will then be directed to the wages/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.

My parents work out of the country. They don’t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?
If your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.

Who can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?
Independent students may only include their spouse and/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.

I completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven’t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?
When we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit fafsa.gov to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA. If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application’s status.

I don’t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan. What other options do I have?
If your parent applies for and is denied a PLUS loan you may be able to borrow additional unsubsidized Direct Loan funds. You may also visit our Private Education Loans page for information on private educational loans.

Do I have to accept my loans again for the spring?
If, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.

My lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven’t you received them?
It may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.

When should I expect to receive my refund?
Please see the Bursar’s Office Refunds page for information.

Where can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?
All of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).

What is UT Dallas’ FAFSA school code?
Our school code is 009741.

Do I have to complete a new FAFSA every year?
Yes. Please visit the Deadlines page for priority deadline information.

Do I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid?
You may complete a FAFSA at any time; however, we cannot process an award until you are officially admitted to UT Dallas.

May I transfer my financial aid from my old school to UT Dallas?
While your financial aid awards (grants, loans, etc.) do not transfer from one school to another, almost all schools in the United States use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as the application for financial aid.  You can visit studentaid.gov and correct your FAFSA to include UT Dallas (school code 009741). UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.

Can I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?
A: Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.

Do you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?
Students should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.

How do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?
You must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.

My parents don’t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?
The law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA’s topic on Dependency Status.

My parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?
There is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the “Will Not File” option. They will then be directed to the wages/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.

My parents work out of the country. They don’t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?
If your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.

Who can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?
Independent students may only include their spouse and/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.

I completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven’t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?
When we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit fafsa.gov to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA. If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application’s status.

I don’t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan. What other options do I have?
If your parent applies for and is denied a PLUS loan you may be able to borrow additional unsubsidized Direct Loan funds. You may also visit our Private Education Loans page for information on private educational loans.

Do I have to accept my loans again for the spring?
If, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.

My lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven’t you received them?
It may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.

When should I expect to receive my refund?
Please see the Bursar’s Office Refunds page for information.

Where can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?
All of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).

I need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet. What should I do?

125,receiving-aid,receiving-aid verification 1,"What is verification?

We will communicate with you, by mail or UT Dallas email, if additional documentation is needed to complete the verification process.

Customized Information from UTD

Glossary
Cost of Attendance (COA): The total amount (not including grants and scholarships) that it will cost you to go to school during the 2020–21 school year. COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you’re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution’s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.

C
Cancellation [of a Loan]
The release of the borrower’s obligation to repay all or a designated portion of principal and interest on a student loan. Also called discharge or forgiveness of a loan.
Capitalization
The addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of a loan. When the interest is not paid as it accrues during periods of in-school status, the grace period, deferment or forbearance, your lender may capitalize the interest. This increases the outstanding principal amount due on the loan and may cause your monthly payment amount to increase. Interest is then charged on that higher principal balance, increasing the overall cost of the loan.
Collection Agency
An entity that recovers unpaid debt from borrowers who have defaulted on their loans.
Collection Costs
Expenses charged on defaulted federal student loans that are added to the outstanding principal balance of the loan. These expenses can be up to 18.5 percent of the principal and interest for defaulted Direct Loans or FFEL Program loans and may exceed 18.5 percent for defaulted Federal Perkins Loans and Health and Human Service (HHS) loans.

Consolidation Loan
Also called Loan Consolidation, a consolidation loan combines several student loans into one bigger loan from a single lender.

The primary intention is to replace multiple loans with a single “consolidated” loan to simplify repayment. For federal student loans, a consolidation loan can also provide access to alternate repayment terms and the ability to lock in a rate on older variable rate student loans. For private student loans, a consolidation loan can also offer the opportunity to get a better interest rate or release a cosigner if the borrower’s credit score has improved significantly.
Cosigner
A cosigner on a loan assumes responsibility for the loan if the borrower should fail to repay it.
Cost of Attendance (COA)
The estimated total amount it will cost you to go to school, usually stated as a yearly figure, that is used in that financial aid eligibility determination.

It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, including an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer (one time allowance); costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and dependent care expenses, and can also include housing and food for up to three semesters or the equivalent at the institution. But no more than two of those semesters, or the equivalent, may be consecutive. Contact your financial aid counselor if you have any unusual expenses that might affect your COA.
Credit Bureau

Data Retrieval Tool (DRT)
The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows applicants who have already filed their federal income tax returns to prefill the answers to some questions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by transferring data from their federal income tax returns. This can save the family some time in completing the FAFSA. It may also reduce the likelihood that your FAFSA will be selected for verification.
Default

Deferment
A postponement of payment on a loan that is allowed under certain conditions and during which interest does not accrue on Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans, and Federal Perkins Loans. All other federal student loans that are deferred will continue to accrue interest. Any unpaid interest that accrued during the deferment period may be added to the principal balance (capitalized) of the loan(s).
Delinquent
A loan is delinquent when loan payments are not received by the due dates. A loan remains delinquent until the borrower makes up the missed payment(s) through payment, deferment, or forbearance. If the borrower is unable to make payments, he or she should contact his or her loan servicer to discuss options to keep the loan in good standing.
Dependency Status
The determination of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) applicant as dependent or independent.

The most common loan forgiveness programs cancel all or part of the debt for working in a particular field or performing military or volunteer service. Loan forgiveness for working in a particular occupation is tax-free, while other types of loan forgiveness may result in a tax liability. There are two main types of loan forgiveness: up front and back end. Up front loan forgiveness cancels a portion of the debt for each year of service. Back end loan forgiveness cancels any remaining debt after a specified number of years of service. Both discharge and forgiveness are types of loan cancellation. See also public service loan forgiveness.

Unpaid interest that accrues during the forbearance will be added to the principal balance (capitalized) of your loan(s), increasing the total amount you owe.
Forgiveness
Loan forgiveness releases the borrower from his or her obligation to repay the loan, usually due to circumstances within the borrower’s control. The most common loan forgiveness programs cancel all or part of the debt for working in a particular field or performing military or volunteer service. Loan forgiveness for working in a particular occupation is tax-free, while other types of loan forgiveness may result in a tax liability. There are two main types of loan forgiveness: up front and back end. Up front loan forgiveness cancels a portion of the debt for each year of service. Back end loan forgiveness cancels any remaining debt after a specified number of years of service. Both discharge and forgiveness are types of loan cancellation. See also public service loan forgiveness.

Capitalization
The addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of a loan. When the interest is not paid as it accrues during periods of in-school status, the grace period, deferment or forbearance, your lender may capitalize the interest.

It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, including an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer (one time allowance); costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and dependent care expenses, and can also include housing and food for up to three semesters or the equivalent at the institution. But no more than two of those semesters, or the equivalent, may be consecutive. Contact your financial aid counselor if you have any unusual expenses that might affect your COA.

Data Retrieval Tool (DRT)
The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows applicants who have already filed their federal income tax returns to prefill the answers to some questions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by transferring data from their federal income tax returns. This can save the family some time in completing the FAFSA. It may also reduce the likelihood that your FAFSA will be selected for verification.

Under an income contingent repayment schedule, the size of the monthly payments depends on the income earned by the borrower. As the borrower’s income increases, so do the payments. The income contingent repayment plan is not available for PLUS Loans. Income contingent repayment is available only in the Direct Loan program. Monthly payments are capped at 20% of discretionary income, where discretionary income is defined as the amount by which income exceeds 100% of the poverty line.

Capitalization
The addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of a loan. When the interest is not paid as it accrues during periods of in-school status, the grace period, deferment or forbearance, your lender may capitalize the interest.

For federal student loans, a consolidation loan can also provide access to alternate repayment terms and the ability to lock in a rate on older variable rate student loans. For private student loans, a consolidation loan can also offer the opportunity to get a better interest rate or release a cosigner if the borrower’s credit score has improved significantly.

It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, including an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer (one time allowance); costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and dependent care expenses, and can also include housing and food for up to three semesters or the equivalent at the institution. But no more than two of those semesters, or the equivalent, may be consecutive. Contact your financial aid counselor if you have any unusual expenses that might affect your COA.
Credit Bureau

Data Retrieval Tool (DRT)
The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows applicants who have already filed their federal income tax returns to prefill the answers to some questions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by transferring data from their federal income tax returns. This can save the family some time in completing the FAFSA. It may also reduce the likelihood that your FAFSA will be selected for verification.

When the interest is not paid as it accrues during periods of in-school status, the grace period, deferment or forbearance, your lender may capitalize the interest. This increases the outstanding principal amount due on the loan and may cause your monthly payment amount to increase. Interest is then charged on that higher principal balance, increasing the overall cost of the loan.
Collection Agency

For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and dependent care expenses, and can also include housing and food for up to three semesters or the equivalent at the institution. But no more than two of those semesters, or the equivalent, may be consecutive. Contact your financial aid counselor if you have any unusual expenses that might affect your COA.
Credit Bureau

s obligation to repay all or a designated portion of principal and interest on a student loan. Also called discharge or forgiveness of a loan.
Capitalization
The addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of a loan. When the interest is not paid as it accrues during periods of in-school status, the grace period, deferment or forbearance, your lender may capitalize the interest. This increases the outstanding principal amount due on the loan and may cause your monthly payment amount to increase. Interest is then charged on that higher principal balance, increasing the overall cost of the loan.
Collection Agency
An entity that recovers unpaid debt from borrowers who have defaulted on their loans.
Collection Costs
Expenses charged on defaulted federal student loans that are added to the outstanding principal balance of the loan. These expenses can be up to 18.5 percent of the principal and interest for defaulted Direct Loans or FFEL Program loans and may exceed 18.5 percent for defaulted Federal Perkins Loans and Health and Human Service (HHS) loans.

Consolidation Loan
Also called Loan Consolidation, a consolidation loan combines several student loans into one bigger loan from a single lender. The consolidation loan is like a refinance and is used to pay off the balances on the other loans. The primary intention is to replace multiple loans with a single “consolidated” loan to simplify repayment. For federal student loans, a consolidation loan can also provide access to alternate repayment terms and the ability to lock in a rate on older variable rate student loans. For private student loans, a consolidation loan can also offer the opportunity to get a better interest rate or release a cosigner if the borrower’s credit score has improved significantly.
Cosigner
A cosigner on a loan assumes responsibility for the loan if the borrower should fail to repay it.
Cost of Attendance (COA)
The estimated total amount it will cost you to go to school, usually stated as a yearly figure, that is used in that financial aid eligibility determination.

It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, including an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer (one time allowance); costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees and an allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and dependent care expenses, and can also include housing and food for up to three semesters or the equivalent at the institution. But no more than two of those semesters, or the equivalent, may be consecutive. Contact your financial aid counselor if you have any unusual expenses that might affect your COA.
Credit Bureau

Data Retrieval Tool (DRT)
The IRS Data Retrieval Tool allows applicants who have already filed their federal income tax returns to prefill the answers to some questions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by transferring data from their federal income tax returns. This can save the family some time in completing the FAFSA. It may also reduce the likelihood that your FAFSA will be selected for verification.
Default

Deferment
A postponement of payment on a loan that is allowed under certain conditions and during which interest does not accrue on Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans, and Federal Perkins Loans. All other federal student loans that are deferred will continue to accrue interest. Any unpaid interest that accrued during the deferment period may be added to the principal balance (capitalized) of the loan(s).
Delinquent
A loan is delinquent when loan payments are not received by the due dates. A loan remains delinquent until the borrower makes up the missed payment(s) through payment, deferment, or forbearance. If the borrower is unable to make payments, he or she should contact his or her loan servicer to discuss options to keep the loan in good standing.

The programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 that provide grants, loans and work-study funds from the federal government to eligible students enrolled in college or career school.
Federal Student Loan
A loan funded by the federal government to help pay for your education. A federal student loan is borrowed money you must repay with interest.
Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)
The SEOG is a federal grant program for undergraduate students with exceptional need. Federal Pell Grant recipients receive priority.
Federal Work-Study

Financial Need
The difference between the cost of attendance (COA) and your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). This is used to determine your eligibility for need based aid programs.
Forbearance
A period during which your monthly loan payments are temporarily suspended or reduced. Your lender may grant you a forbearance if you are willing but unable to make loan payments due to certain types of financial hardships. During forbearance, principal payments are postponed but interest continues to accrue. Unpaid interest that accrues during the forbearance will be added to the principal balance (capitalized) of your loan(s), increasing the total amount you owe.
Forgiveness
Loan forgiveness releases the borrower from his or her obligation to repay the loan, usually due to circumstances within the borrower’s control. The most common loan forgiveness programs cancel all or part of the debt for working in a particular field or performing military or volunteer service. Loan forgiveness for working in a particular occupation is tax-free, while other types of loan forgiveness may result in a tax liability. There are two main types of loan forgiveness: up front and back end. Up front loan forgiveness cancels a portion of the debt for each year of service. Back end loan forgiveness cancels any remaining debt after a specified number of years of service. Both discharge and forgiveness are types of loan cancellation. See also public service loan forgiveness.
Foster Care

174,withdrawal-policy,withdrawal-policy 1,"Students who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester
If you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University’s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar’s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.
The federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.
A calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.
In order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)
The Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually “earned” and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student’s date of withdrawal from all classes.
How the calculation works:

Number of days attended ÷ Days in semester = percent of semester completed
Total $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $
Total $ disbursed – Earned $ = $ to be returned

Students who drop courses but still are enrolled
Each federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.
Adjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.
Students who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.
Students who fail all courses
If you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.
Other information regarding withdrawing from classes
These regulations are not the same as the University’s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester’s Academic Calendar.
Please refer to the Bursar’s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.
