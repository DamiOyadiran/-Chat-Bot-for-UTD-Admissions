Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551).

Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is a Direct Unsubsidized Loan?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

A waiver is a type of financial assistance that allows certain nonresidents of Texas to pay the in-state tuition rate.\nIn order to qualify for many of the tuition and\/or fee exemptions or waivers, students must be enrolled in a UT Dallas academic program that is funded by the state of Texas. Undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA, and graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Additionally, resident undergraduate students must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar in accordance with Texas Education Code \u00a7 54.014.

Additionally, undergraduate students must not have completed a number of semester credit hours that is considered to be excessive as outlined in\u00a0Texas Education Code 54.014. Legacy Act students must be enrolled in a degree program and may not exempt more than the degree plan maximum hours.\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption benefits will not be processed for subsequent terms until the previous term\u2019s academic progress has been reviewed and continuing program eligibility has been verified.\nThe above GPA requirements are not applicable to the children and spouses of a MIA, KIA, or service-connected deceased Veteran.\n\nHow many hours do I need to enroll in to receive the Hazlewood Exemption?\nThere is no minimum course load required to receive the Hazlewood Exemption; however, if you are eligible, there are minimum requirements for both\u00a0financial aid\u00a0and\u00a0federal VA benefits.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop or withdraw from a course while receiving the Hazlewood Exemption?\nIf you drop a course before\u00a0Census Day\u00a0but remain enrolled in at least one other course, the hours related to the dropped course will not be charged toward your Hazlewood eligibility. However, if you drop or withdraw from a course(s) after Census Day, the hours related to the course(s) dropped will be deducted from your Hazlewood eligibility. If you withdraw from all courses after the final day to receive a 100% refund, you will be charged Hazlewood hours based on the\u00a0Payment & Refund Calendar.\nPlease note, dropping or withdrawing from a course may also affect your eligibility for financial aid and\/or federal VA benefits.\n\nIs there an age limit for the Hazlewood Exemption?\nIn order to maintain eligibility for the Legacy Program under the Hazlewood Exemption, a student must be 25 years or younger on the first day of the term for which the exemption is claimed (unless granted an extension due to a qualifying illness or debilitating condition). There is no age limit for a veteran or for the spouse or child of a veteran who was 100% disabled or deceased as a result of service-related injury or illness.\n\nAre any programs excluded from the Hazlewood Exemption at UT Dallas?\nExecutive education and certain certificate programs are not eligible for the Hazlewood exemption for the reason that the school does not receive state formula funding (tax support) for these programs.\n\nWhat is a Certificate of Eligibility for Federal GI Bill benefits (COE) and how do I get one?\nA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is an official correspondence from the VA stating your federal education benefits status. The certificate will state whether you have exhausted your eligibility for GI Bill benefits (Chapters 31, 33 [Post-9\/11]). COE\u2019s may be obtained by completing a\u00a0Online GI Bill\u00ae Application\u00a0or by calling 1-888-GI-Bill-1.\n\nI used the Hazlewood Exemption at another school. Do I need to complete another application?\nYes. State law requires all schools to maintain their own Hazlewood exemption records. Each school also is required to verify your attempted Hazlewood hours from all previously attended institutions.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and VA Benefits?\nA student may use Chapter 33 (Post-9\/11 GI Bill) or Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation) with Hazlewood during the same term if the combination of benefits does not exceed the total amount of tuition and fees. In either case, Hazlewood benefits may cover eligible tuition and fees that are not covered by Ch. 33 or Ch. 31 tuition and fees payments. A student may receive the full amount of federal education benefits issued under Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB, Chapter 30 & Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Post Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32) in conjunction with Hazlewood.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and other forms of financial aid?\nWhile the Hazlewood exemption may be used in conjunction with some other forms of financial aid, such as federal grants, outside scholarships, loans, and work-study, it must fit within your Cost of Attendance (COA) and contribute to your financial need, if applicable. Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only. Consequently, those funds may not be received in addition to the Hazlewood Exemption. If financial aid is already disbursed or awarded at the time your Hazlewood exemption is approved, adjustments may be made to your financial aid to allow for the exemption. Additionally, exemption amounts will be adjusted to allow for any federal VA education (Post-9\/11 GI Bill) benefits that are received.\n\nWhere can I find veteran services other than Hazlewood at the university?\nUT Dallas provides a full service\u00a0Military and Veteran Center\u00a0with resources for veterans, reservists, eligible dependents, and active duty military students.\n\nWhere can I learn more about the Hazlewood Act?\nWe encourage you to review the program guidance found on the\u00a0Texas Veterans Commission\u2019s website.

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq 3\n processed.\u00a0 We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.\n\nAre there any fees that the VA will not cover?\nYes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551).

Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.\nAppeal Process\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the petition and will contact the student when a decision has been made.

Exemptions, waivers, and veterans benefits each have application processes outside of the general financial aid application process. The types of aid programs are listed below with more information.\nGrants\nGrants do not have to be repaid and are usually awarded based on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), as calculated using the data on your financial aid application, and your financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at The University of Texas at Dallas.\nStudent Loans\nStudent loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans and private loans.\nWork-Study\nWork-study is a form of financial aid that allows you to work, usually in an on-campus position, to earn the funding offered to you by the Office of Financial Aid.

The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.\nExemptions and Waivers\nExemptions\nExemption programs provide funding that effectively exempt you from having to pay a portion or all of your tuition or, in some cases, your tuition and fees. Exemption programs are available for certain eligible students who are classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nWaivers\nWaiver programs are designed to waive the out-of-state portion of your non-resident tuition. Waiver programs are available for certain eligible students who are not classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nVeterans Benefits\nVeterans Benefits include federal and state funding programs for eligible veterans and service members and, in some cases, their spouses and dependents.

{"prompt":"aid-programs 1\nWork-Study \n\nWhen you submit a financial aid application to the Office of Financial Aid, you are seeking help with funding your educational expenses. Some forms of funding do not have to be repaid, while student loans require repayment with interest, and work-study requires employment. Exemptions, waivers, and veterans benefits each have application processes outside of the general financial aid application process. The types of aid programs are listed below with more information.\nGrants\nGrants do not have to be repaid and are usually awarded based on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), as calculated using the data on your financial aid application, and your financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at The University of Texas at Dallas.\nStudent Loans\nStudent loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans and private loans.\nWork-Study\nWork-study is a form of financial aid that allows you to work, usually in an on-campus position, to earn the funding offered to you by the Office of Financial Aid. Work-study requires that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas. The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.\nExemptions and Waivers\nExemptions\nExemption programs provide funding that effectively exempt you from having to pay a portion or all of your tuition or, in some cases, your tuition and fees. Exemption programs are available for certain eligible students who are classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nWaivers\nWaiver programs are designed to waive the out-of-state portion of your non-resident tuition. Waiver programs are available for certain eligible students who are not classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nVeterans Benefits\nVeterans Benefits include federal and state funding programs for eligible veterans and service members and, in some cases, their spouses and dependents.

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits hazlewood-exemption hazlewood-faq 1\nWhat is the deadline to apply for Hazlewood?\nThe priority deadline for submitting all required documentation is\u00a0July 15\u00a0for the upcoming academic year. If we have received all required forms by the priority deadline, the exemption will be in place before the\u00a0Full Term Census Day\u00a0as noted in the\u00a0Academic Calendar. We continue to process late applications in the order they are received. However, applicants who submit documentation after the start of the term are strongly encouraged to consider making alternate payment arrangements with the Bursar\u2019s Office in order to meet the payment deadline. Late submission of documents may result in late fees and\/or cancelled enrollment. Applications and all supporting documentation may be submitted no later than the last day of class for any given term. Hazlewood is not retroactive to prior terms.\n\nIs there a minimum academic requirement?\nAll undergraduate and graduate Hazlewood recipients (Veteran, Legacy, and Dependent of 100% Disabled Veteran) must meet\u00a0cumulative GPA requirements\u00a0as defined by the Office of Financial Aid. Additionally, undergraduate students must not have completed a number of semester credit hours that is considered to be excessive as outlined in\u00a0Texas Education Code 54.014. Legacy Act students must be enrolled in a degree program and may not exempt more than the degree plan maximum hours.\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption benefits will not be processed for subsequent terms until the previous term\u2019s academic progress has been reviewed and continuing program eligibility has been verified.\nThe above GPA requirements are not applicable to the children and spouses of a MIA, KIA, or service-connected deceased Veteran.\n\nHow many hours do I need to enroll in to receive the Hazlewood Exemption?\nThere is no minimum course load required to receive the Hazlewood Exemption; however, if you are eligible, there are minimum requirements for both\u00a0financial aid\u00a0and\u00a0federal VA benefits.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop or withdraw from a course while receiving the Hazlewood Exemption?\nIf you drop a course before\u00a0Census Day\u00a0but remain enrolled in at least one other course, the hours related to the dropped course will not be charged toward your Hazlewood eligibility. However, if you drop or withdraw from a course(s) after Census Day, the hours related to the course(s) dropped will be deducted from your Hazlewood eligibility. If you withdraw from all courses after the final day to receive a 100% refund, you will be charged Hazlewood hours based on the\u00a0Payment & Refund Calendar.\nPlease note, dropping or withdrawing from a course may also affect your eligibility for financial aid and\/or federal VA benefits.\n\nIs there an age limit for the Hazlewood Exemption?\nIn order to maintain eligibility for the Legacy Program under the Hazlewood Exemption, a student must be 25 years or younger on the first day of the term for which the exemption is claimed (unless granted an extension due to a qualifying illness or debilitating condition). There is no age limit for a veteran or for the spouse or child of a veteran who was 100% disabled or deceased as a result of service-related injury or illness.\n\nAre any programs excluded from the Hazlewood Exemption at UT Dallas?\nExecutive education and certain certificate programs are not eligible for the Hazlewood exemption for the reason that the school does not receive state formula funding (tax support) for these programs.\n\nWhat is a Certificate of Eligibility for Federal GI Bill benefits (COE) and how do I get one?\nA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is an official correspondence from the VA stating your federal education benefits status. The certificate will state whether you have exhausted your eligibility for GI Bill benefits (Chapters 31, 33 [Post-9\/11]). COE\u2019s may be obtained by completing a\u00a0Online GI Bill\u00ae Application\u00a0or by calling 1-888-GI-Bill-1.\n\nI used the Hazlewood Exemption at another school. Do I need to complete another application?\nYes. State law requires all schools to maintain their own Hazlewood exemption records. Each school also is required to verify your attempted Hazlewood hours from all previously attended institutions.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and VA Benefits?\nA student may use Chapter 33 (Post-9\/11 GI Bill) or Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation) with Hazlewood during the same term if the combination of benefits does not exceed the total amount of tuition and fees. In either case, Hazlewood benefits may cover eligible tuition and fees that are not covered by Ch. 33 or Ch. 31 tuition and fees payments. A student may receive the full amount of federal education benefits issued under Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB, Chapter 30 & Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Post Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32) in conjunction with Hazlewood.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and other forms of financial aid?\nWhile the Hazlewood exemption may be used in conjunction with some other forms of financial aid, such as federal grants, outside scholarships, loans, and work-study, it must fit within your Cost of Attendance (COA) and contribute to your financial need, if applicable. Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only. Consequently, those funds may not be received in addition to the Hazlewood Exemption. If financial aid is already disbursed or awarded at the time your Hazlewood exemption is approved, adjustments may be made to your financial aid to allow for the exemption.

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the phone number for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the Spouse\/Child of 100% Disabled or Deceased Veteran?\n Related:","completion":" no"}
{"prompt":"receiving-aid verification 1\nWhat is verification?\n\nVerification is a process for confirming the accuracy of the data reported on the FAFSA through the review of supporting documentation. The U.S. Department of Education selects some FAFSAs for verification, while other FAFSAs may be selected for verification by the institution. Students may be selected for verification randomly or because the data provided on the FAFSA was incomplete or inconsistent.\n\nWhat do I do if my FAFSA is selected for verification?\nIf your FAFSA is selected for verification, you will be notified on your Student Aid Report (SAR), as well as by our office. We will communicate with you, by mail or UT Dallas email, if additional documentation is needed to complete the verification process. We will send you a list of information needed to complete the verification process. You may also find the list of requested documents by reviewing the\u00a0To Do List\u00a0in your Orion Student Center.\n\nHow do I submit my documents?\nYou may submit your documents by email attachment (PDF format preferred) to\u00a0financial-aid@utdallas.edu.

Continue to monitor your UT Dallas email account after you have submitted documents. This is how we will contact you if additional clarification and\/or documentation is needed. As part of the verification process, we may correct information on your FAFSA based on the documentation that you submit.\n\nHow long does verification take?\nThe average processing time for verification is two to three weeks from the date we receive all of the requested documents.\n\nWhat kind of documentation is required if my FAFSA is selected for verification?\nThe Department of Education tells us what documents we are required to request and review as part of the verification process. The requested documentation can include tax information, verification worksheets, proof of high school completion, and\/or other documents that may be used to confirm the information reported on the FAFSA.\u00a0\n\nTax Information\n\nThere are two ways to submit a copy of your tax information to our office for the verification process. The first way to do this is to return to\u00a0the FAFSA website and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to transfer your or your parent\u2019s tax information directly from the IRS.\nIf you are unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool and you have been selected for verification, you will need to obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS. This can be done online at\u00a0www.irs.gov, by calling\u00a0800-908-9946, or by completing and submitting\u00a0IRS Form 4506-T\u00a0to the IRS by fax or by mail.\n\nTax Information for Special Cases\nCertain tax-filers may be unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool or obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS and\/or may be required to submit additional or alternate tax documentation for the verification process. Please see the information below for requested verification documentation in these special cases.\n\nMarried Filing Separate Returns: If you or your parents were married as of the date of completing the FAFSA but filed a separate return from your\/their spouse in the tax year used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Transcript for both tax-filers\n\nJoint Return Filed, No Longer Married: If you or your parents filed a joint return for the tax year used on the FASFA but were no longer married as of the day the FASFA was completed, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Transcript\nA copy of the IRS Form W-2 for you\/the parent listed on the FAFSA\n\nAmended Tax Returns:\u00a0If you or your parent filed an amended tax return for the tax year used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Transcript\nA signed copy of the IRS Form 1040X that was filed with the IRS\n\nFilers of Non-U.S. Tax Returns: If you or your parent filed a tax return in another country for the tax year used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA signed copy of the foreign tax return or the tax return transcript that is translated into English and has the monetary amounts converted into U.S. dollars\n\nVictims of Tax-Related Identity Theft: If you or your parent was a victim of tax-related identity theft for the tax years used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Database View (TRDBV), obtained by calling the IRS\u2019s Identity Protection Specialized Unit (IPSU) at 800-908-4490\nA signed statement from the tax-filer indicating that they were a victim of tax-related identify theft and that the IRS has been made aware\n\nTax Filing Extension: If you or your parent has filed an extension with the IRS beyond the automatic six-month extension period for the tax year used on the FASFA, submit:\n\nA copy of IRS Form 4868\nA copy of the IRS\u2019s approval of an extension beyond the automatic six-month extension period\nIRS Verification of Non-Filing Letter\nCopies of W-2s for the tax year or, for a self-employed person, a signed statement certifying the Adjusted Gross Income and Taxes Paid\n\nVerification Worksheets\nWe may request verification worksheets from you to verify your\/your parent\u2019s household size, the number of household members in college, or to confirm that you or your parent did not and will not file a tax return.\u00a0 We will send a worksheet containing the requested information to your UT Dallas email address when you are selected for verification. Copies of the verification worksheets can also be found on our\u00a0forms\u00a0page.\u00a0 Be sure to complete the form(s) for the appropriate aid year and to sign the form(s) with handwritten signature(s). We cannot accept typed signatures on verification documents.\n\nWhat is the deadline for submitting verification documents?\nVerification document submissions are accepted throughout the aid year. However, it is in your best interest to submit your documents as soon as possible. We will not offer you financial aid until the verification process has been completed.\nPlease note that it is possible to be selected for verification after you have been offered financial aid or after financial aid has been applied or disbursed to your account. When this happens you have 30 days to provide the requested documents. We may cancel the financial aid offered or disbursed if the requested materials are not submitted within this time frame. If you are unable to submit your documents by the 30-day deadline, please contact your\u00a0financial aid counselor\u00a0to request an extension.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the Returning UT Dallas Student who wishes to renew the Hazlewood Exemption?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

The U.S. Department of Education selects some FAFSAs for verification, while other FAFSAs may be selected for verification by the institution. Students may be selected for verification randomly or because the data provided on the FAFSA was incomplete or inconsistent.\n\nWhat do I do if my FAFSA is selected for verification?\nIf your FAFSA is selected for verification, you will be notified on your Student Aid Report (SAR), as well as by our office. We will communicate with you, by mail or UT Dallas email, if additional documentation is needed to complete the verification process. We will send you a list of information needed to complete the verification process. You may also find the list of requested documents by reviewing the\u00a0To Do List\u00a0in your Orion Student Center.\n\nHow do I submit my documents?\nYou may submit your documents by email attachment (PDF format preferred) to\u00a0financial-aid@utdallas.edu.

The requested documentation can include tax information, verification worksheets, proof of high school completion, and\/or other documents that may be used to confirm the information reported on the FAFSA.\u00a0\n\nTax Information\n\nThere are two ways to submit a copy of your tax information to our office for the verification process. The first way to do this is to return to\u00a0the FAFSA website and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to transfer your or your parent\u2019s tax information directly from the IRS.\nIf you are unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool and you have been selected for verification, you will need to obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS.

We cannot accept typed signatures on verification documents.\n\nWhat is the deadline for submitting verification documents?\nVerification document submissions are accepted throughout the aid year.

We will not offer you financial aid until the verification process has been completed.\nPlease note that it is possible to be selected for verification after you have been offered financial aid or after financial aid has been applied or disbursed to your account. When this happens you have 30 days to provide the requested documents. We may cancel the financial aid offered or disbursed if the requested materials are not submitted within this time frame.

A student may receive the full amount of federal education benefits issued under Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB, Chapter 30 & Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Post Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32) in conjunction with Hazlewood.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and other forms of financial aid?\nWhile the Hazlewood exemption may be used in conjunction with some other forms of financial aid, such as federal grants, outside scholarships, loans, and work-study, it must fit within your Cost of Attendance (COA) and contribute to your financial need, if applicable. Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only. Consequently, those funds may not be received in addition to the Hazlewood Exemption. If financial aid is already disbursed or awarded at the time your Hazlewood exemption is approved, adjustments may be made to your financial aid to allow for the exemption. Additionally, exemption amounts will be adjusted to allow for any federal VA education (Post-9\/11 GI Bill) benefits that are received.\n\nWhere can I find veteran services other than Hazlewood at the university?\nUT Dallas provides a full service\u00a0Military and Veteran Center\u00a0with resources for veterans, reservists, eligible dependents, and active duty military students.\n\nWhere can I learn more about the Hazlewood Act?\nWe encourage you to review the program guidance found on the\u00a0Texas Veterans Commission\u2019s website.

You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551).

{"prompt":"receiving-aid verification 1\nWhat is verification?\n\nVerification is a process for confirming the accuracy of the data reported on the FAFSA through the review of supporting documentation. The U.S. Department of Education selects some FAFSAs for verification, while other FAFSAs may be selected for verification by the institution. Students may be selected for verification randomly or because the data provided on the FAFSA was incomplete or inconsistent.\n\nWhat do I do if my FAFSA is selected for verification?\nIf your FAFSA is selected for verification, you will be notified on your Student Aid Report (SAR), as well as by our office. We will communicate with you, by mail or UT Dallas email, if additional documentation is needed to complete the verification process. We will send you a list of information needed to complete the verification process. You may also find the list of requested documents by reviewing the\u00a0To Do List\u00a0in your Orion Student Center.\n\nHow do I submit my documents?\nYou may submit your documents by email attachment (PDF format preferred) to\u00a0financial-aid@utdallas.edu.

The requested documentation can include tax information, verification worksheets, proof of high school completion, and\/or other documents that may be used to confirm the information reported on the FAFSA.\u00a0\n\nTax Information\n\nThere are two ways to submit a copy of your tax information to our office for the verification process. The first way to do this is to return to\u00a0the FAFSA website and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to transfer your or your parent\u2019s tax information directly from the IRS.\nIf you are unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool and you have been selected for verification, you will need to obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS.

We cannot accept typed signatures on verification documents.\n\nWhat is the deadline for submitting verification documents?\nVerification document submissions are accepted throughout the aid year. However, it is in your best interest to submit your documents as soon as possible. We will not offer you financial aid until the verification process has been completed.\nPlease note that it is possible to be selected for verification after you have been offered financial aid or after financial aid has been applied or disbursed to your account.

If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: When can you get a book voucher?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student\u2019s overall successfully completed hours by the student\u2019s overall attempted hours.\nThe undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.\nUndergraduate Pace Rate:\nAttempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%\nThe graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.\nIncompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic\/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.\nTransfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student\u2019s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student\u2019s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.\nRepeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student\u2019s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student\u2019s cumulative GPA.\nStudents must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.\nFailure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards\nIn these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students\u2019 UT Dallas email address.\nStudent records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status.

Unless otherwise notified by your servicer, your first monthly payment will be due after your grace period ends. For PLUS loans, repayment begins once the loan has fully disbursed, but students and parents may be eligible for an in-school deferment; contact the loan servicer for more information.\nYou will be making your loan payments to your federal loan servicer, the company that handles the billing and other services on your federal student loan. You can find out who your servicer is and locate their contact information by logging into the Federal Student Aid website.\nIf you have trouble repaying your loans, you should contact your servicer as soon as possible. They can work with you to find the best option for your situation, including changing your repayment plan or requesting a deferment or forbearance. Deferment and forbearance may allow you to temporarily stop making or reduce your loan payments.\nThe following resources are good sources for information on repaying your federal student loans:\n\nExit Counseling \u2013 Completing a Direct Loan Exit Counseling session is required before you graduate, withdraw, or cease attending half-time. The session provides basic information on repaying your loans and informs you of your rights and responsibilities as a student loan borrower.\nYour Servicer \u2013 Maintaining contact with your federal loan servicer is essential throughout the repayment process and they can help with many of the details of repaying your loans. They are also your contact point if you should have trouble repaying your loans.\nStudentAid.gov \u2013 The \u201cMy Aid\u201d summary, accessed by logging into Federal Student Aid, provides detail on what kind of loans you have borrowed, the amounts of those loans, and provides you with your loan servicer\u2019s name and contact information. You can also find a variety of resources, including a repayment estimator and answers to many frequently asked questions about repayment on the Manage Loans section of the Federal Student Aid website.\n\nPerkins Loan Repayment\nThe grace period for Perkins loans is 9 months and the first payment will be due at the end of the grace period.

This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student\u2019s overall successfully completed hours by the student\u2019s overall attempted hours.\nThe undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.\nUndergraduate Pace Rate:\nAttempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%\nThe graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.\nIncompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic\/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.\nTransfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student\u2019s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student\u2019s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.\nRepeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student\u2019s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student\u2019s cumulative GPA.\nStudents must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing.

All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.\nFailure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards\nIn these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students\u2019 UT Dallas email address.\nStudent records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average.

For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: Can I take a course at another school and\n Related:","completion":" yes"}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How far back can I be certified?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

For example, if a parent becomes unemployed, disabled or deceased, the FAA can decide to use estimated income information for the award year instead of the actual income figures from the base year.

It lists the terms and conditions under which you agree to repay the loan and explains your rights and responsibilities as a borrower.

Students needing help resolving problems concerning their Selective Service registration should call 1-847-688-6888.\nShort Term Loan\nThe short-term loan is a payment plan that The University of Texas at Dallas offers to students enrolled in a full-term session for tuition and course-related fees.

If there are no corrections or additional information you must provide, the SAR will contain your EFC, which is the number that is used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid.\nSubsidized Loan\nA loan based on financial need for which the federal government pays the interest that accrues while the borrower is in an in-school, grace, or deferment status. For Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2014, the borrower will be responsible for paying any interest that accrues during the grace period.

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq #va-ro 3\n processed.\u00a0 We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.\n\nAre there any fees that the VA will not cover?\nYes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are the financial aid deadlines for incoming and continuing undergraduate students?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only.

For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans.

{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans private-loans 1\nPrivate Loan Repayment\n\nIt is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan. Private loans are usually more expensive than federal loans, so you and your family should consider obtaining a private loan only after exhausting your federal loan eligibility, including Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS Loans. Learn more information about the two options at the Federal Versus Private Loans website. You can also learn about the maximum amounts of federal aid that you may be eligible to receive by visiting the Federal Loans page.\nApplication Steps for a Private Education Loan\n\nChoose your lender\nComplete the lender\u2019s application process\nReceive funds from the lender\n\nTo assist you in completing the self-certification form, cost of attendance (COA) estimates can be found on the Office of Financial Aid Estimated Costs of Attendance page. Your personal COA can be found by logging into Galaxy. From Galaxy, you can locate COA information by clicking Orion, then Self-Service, and then Campus Finances. Finally, click View Financial Aid, select the aid year for the COA that you would like to view and then click the Cost of Attendance Summary link. You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in determining your COA.\nWhy We Are Providing This Information\nBecause many students and families are unsure of where to begin searching for a legitimate private education loan lender, the Office of Financial Aid compiles an annual list of private education loan lenders. The loans are presented using FASTChoice \u2013 an online tool designed to help you compare a few of your lender options side by side. Remember that you may choose any lender, even if the lender does not appear on our lender list.\nEach lender that appears on this list is required to provide important disclosure information to UT Dallas, prospective students and their families. This important information can be accessed through FASTChoice. If you are unable to access this important information, our office can provide you with an electronic or printed copy. Please contact a member of the loans team by telephone at (972) 883-2941 or by email at faloans@utdallas.edu.\nUnless otherwise stated, none of the lenders on this list are affiliated with one another.\nMethod and Criteria\nEach year, UT Dallas asks private education loan lenders to provide an overview of their loan products for consideration on our lender list. Each lender responds to the same survey that is created by the Office of Financial Aid. The survey requests information about each lender\u2019s practices in the following areas:\n\nBorrower Benefits or Incentives.\nBorrower Eligibility to receive loan funds.\nLoan Interest Rates.\nLoan Repayment Terms.\nLoan Servicing.\nLoan Processing Systems.\nLender History.\n\nEach lender response is reviewed by a committee with regard to the areas listed above.\nWhy Each Lender Was Chosen\nEach loan lender listed must meet all of the following criteria:\n\nNo origination or other fees, deducted from the loan proceeds.\nAll loan products with a minimum interest rate that does not exceed 3.75% as of the time that the lender list is published for the year.\nAvailability of deferment and forbearance options to aid borrowers who experience financial difficulty during loan repayment.\nAvailability of a \u201cBorrower Services Center\u201d that a borrower can contact to receive timely information about his or her private loans.\nAbility to conduct the loan application, school certification, and funds disbursement processes electronically to reduce the time it takes for the borrower to receive funding.\n\nLender List\nLenderWebsitePhone NumberDisclosuresCitizens Bankcitizensbank.com\/studentloans(866) 999-0254Citizens: Disclosure InformationCustom Choice Loan*funded by Citizens Bankcustomchoice.com(866) 232-3889Custom Choice: Disclosure InformationUnion Federal Private Student Loan*funded by Citizens Bankunionfederalstudentloans.com(866) 513-8445Union Federal: Disclosure InformationCollege Avenue Student Loanscollegeavestudentloans.com(844) 422-7502Disclosure InformationCommerce Bankcommercebank.com\/studentloans(855) 342-2006Disclosure InformationDiscover Bankdiscoverstudentloans.com(800) 788-3368Disclosure InformationKentucky Higher Education Student Loan Corporation (KHESLC)kheslc.com(800) 693-8220Disclosure InformationNelnet Banknelnetbank.com(800) 446-4190Disclosure InformationPNC Bankpnconcampus.com(800) 762-1001Disclosure InformationSallie Mae Banksalliemae.com(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationRandolph Brooks Federal Credit Union*funded by Sallie Mae Bankrbfcu.org\/studentloans(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationSoFi Banksofi.com\/private-student-loans\/(855) 456-7634Disclosure InformationTexas Higher Education Coordinating Boardhhloans.com(800) 242-3062Disclosure Information\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: Who is eligible for the preceptor exemption?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office.

{"prompt":"receiving-aid faq 1\nWhat is UT Dallas\u2019 FAFSA school code?\nOur school code is 009741.\n\nDo I have to complete a new FAFSA every year?\nYes. Please visit the\u00a0Deadlines\u00a0page for priority deadline information.\n\nDo I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid?\nYou may complete a FAFSA at any time; however, we cannot process an award until you are officially admitted to UT Dallas.\n\nMay I transfer my financial aid from my old school to UT Dallas?\nWhile your financial aid awards (grants, loans, etc.) do not transfer from one school to another, almost all schools in the United States use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as the application for financial aid.\u00a0 You can visit\u00a0studentaid.gov\u00a0and correct your FAFSA to include UT Dallas (school code 009741). UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nCan I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?\nA:\u00a0Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.\n\nDo you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?\nStudents should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and\/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.\n\nHow do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?\nYou must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?\nThe law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA\u2019s topic on Dependency Status.\n\nMy parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?\nThere is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the \u201cWill Not File\u201d option. They will then be directed to the wages\/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.\n\nMy parents work out of the country. They don\u2019t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?\nIf your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.\n\nWho can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?\nIndependent students may only include their spouse and\/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.\n\nI completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven\u2019t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?\nWhen we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit\u00a0fafsa.gov\u00a0to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA.\u00a0If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application\u2019s status.\n\nI don\u2019t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan. What other options do I have?\nIf your parent applies for and is denied a PLUS loan you may be able to borrow additional unsubsidized Direct Loan funds. You may also visit our\u00a0Private Education Loans\u00a0page for information on private educational loans.\n\nDo I have to accept my loans again for the spring?\nIf, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.\n\nMy lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven\u2019t you received them?\nIt may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.\n\nWhen should I expect to receive my refund?\nPlease see the Bursar\u2019s Office\u00a0Refunds page\u00a0for information.\n\nWhere can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?\nAll of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).\n\nI need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet. What should I do?\nIf your financial aid application is complete and your funds have not disbursed by the first day of classes, you may be eligible for an on-campus book voucher. Book vouchers can be obtained at the Office of Financial Aid in the Student Services Building (SSB). For more information on who qualifies, please see our\u00a0Book Voucher Policy.\n\nWhat is considered a special circumstance?\nA special circumstance is an event that causes a loss of\/significant reduction in income or extremely high medical bills not paid by insurance. Special circumstance forms can be found on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\nWhat types of situations qualify for a Dependency Override?\nPlease see the cover sheet of the Dependency Override Request form on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the deadline to accept or decline the financial aid offer?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid satisfactory-academic-progress 1\nTo be eligible for financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on a qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (completion rate\/maximum timeframe) standard. \nGrade Point Average (GPA)\n\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for undergraduate students is 2.0.\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for graduate students is 3.0.\n\nMaximum Time Frame\n\nThe undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\nThe graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\n\nCompletion Rate\nStudents must successfully complete a percentage of all attempted hours that is in line with completing their degree requirements within the overall maximum time frame for a degree program. This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student\u2019s overall successfully completed hours by the student\u2019s overall attempted hours.\nThe undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.\nUndergraduate Pace Rate:\nAttempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%\nThe graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.\nIncompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic\/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.\nTransfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student\u2019s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student\u2019s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.\nRepeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student\u2019s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student\u2019s cumulative GPA.\nStudents must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.\nFailure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards\nIn these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students\u2019 UT Dallas email address.\nStudent records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.\nAppeal Process\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the petition and will contact the student when a decision has been made. The decision of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee is final.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How will the financial aid award be adjusted if the student's enrollment, major, state residency, housing, or eligibility changes?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"aid-programs 1\nWork-Study \n\nWhen you submit a financial aid application to the Office of Financial Aid, you are seeking help with funding your educational expenses.

Exemptions, waivers, and veterans benefits each have application processes outside of the general financial aid application process. The types of aid programs are listed below with more information.\nGrants\nGrants do not have to be repaid and are usually awarded based on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), as calculated using the data on your financial aid application, and your financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at The University of Texas at Dallas.\nStudent Loans\nStudent loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans and private loans.\nWork-Study\nWork-study is a form of financial aid that allows you to work, usually in an on-campus position, to earn the funding offered to you by the Office of Financial Aid. Work-study requires that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas. The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.\nExemptions and Waivers\nExemptions\nExemption programs provide funding that effectively exempt you from having to pay a portion or all of your tuition or, in some cases, your tuition and fees. Exemption programs are available for certain eligible students who are classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nWaivers\nWaiver programs are designed to waive the out-of-state portion of your non-resident tuition. Waiver programs are available for certain eligible students who are not classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nVeterans Benefits\nVeterans Benefits include federal and state funding programs for eligible veterans and service members and, in some cases, their spouses and dependents.

UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nCan I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?\nA:\u00a0Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.\n\nDo you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?\nStudents should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and\/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.\n\nHow do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?\nYou must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?\nThe law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA\u2019s topic on Dependency Status.\n\nMy parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?\nThere is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the \u201cWill Not File\u201d option.

How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?\nIf your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.\n\nWho can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?\nIndependent students may only include their spouse and\/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year.

Why haven\u2019t you received them?\nIt may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.\n\nWhen should I expect to receive my refund?\nPlease see the Bursar\u2019s Office\u00a0Refunds page\u00a0for information.\n\nWhere can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?\nAll of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).\n\nI need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet.

When this occurs we have a process where you can obtain your books using your anticipated financial aid refund. To obtain a book voucher, you need to meet the following criteria:\n\nYou must apply for financial aid (submit the FAFSA or TASFA) more than two weeks before the first day of classes.\nYou must have provided all of the requested documents at least one week before the first day of classes.\nWe must have awarded you financial aid in an amount that exceeds the tuition, fees, and other Bursar\u2019s Office charges (such as housing, meal plans and parking permits). That is, you must be anticipating a refund from the Bursar\u2019s Office.\n\nThe book voucher is a request by the Office of Financial Aid to the Bursar\u2019s Office that they place a credit on your Comet Card, which you can then use at the UT Dallas University bookstore. Because this is a Comet Card credit, you will not be able to use it at an off-campus bookstore or an on-line bookstore.\nWe try hard to be certain that your financial aid is available for you as soon as possible in the semester. In addition to buying books we know that most of our students have other education-related expenses. The best way to have your funds as soon as possible is for you to apply for financial aid before the posted deadlines. Even if you have missed the deadlines, applying as soon as you know you are planning to attend UT Dallas is in your best interest.\nTo obtain a book voucher, you should visit the first floor of the Student Services Building (SSB).

For example, if a parent becomes unemployed, disabled or deceased, the FAA can decide to use estimated income information for the award year instead of the actual income figures from the base year. This delegation of authority from the federal government to the financial aid administrator is called Professional Judgment (PJ).\nPromissory Note\nThe binding legal document that you must sign when you get a federal student loan. It lists the terms and conditions under which you agree to repay the loan and explains your rights and responsibilities as a borrower. It is important to read and save this document because you will need to refer to it later when you begin repaying your loan or at other times when you need information about provisions of the loan, such as deferment or forbearance.\nQ\nR\nRegular Student\nA student who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment at an institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized education credential offered by that institution.

If the student did not register and is past the age of doing so (18-25), and the school determines that the failure to register was knowingly and willful, the student is ineligible for all federal student financial aid programs. The school\u2019s decision as to whether the failure to register was willful is not subject to appeal. Students needing help resolving problems concerning their Selective Service registration should call 1-847-688-6888.\nShort Term Loan\nThe short-term loan is a payment plan that The University of Texas at Dallas offers to students enrolled in a full-term session for tuition and course-related fees.

If there are no corrections or additional information you must provide, the SAR will contain your EFC, which is the number that is used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid.\nSubsidized Loan\nA loan based on financial need for which the federal government pays the interest that accrues while the borrower is in an in-school, grace, or deferment status. For Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2014, the borrower will be responsible for paying any interest that accrues during the grace period.

{"prompt":"finaid maintaining-aid satisfactory-academic-progress 1\nTo be eligible for financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on a qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (completion rate\/maximum timeframe) standard. \nGrade Point Average (GPA)\n\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for undergraduate students is 2.0.\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for graduate students is 3.0.\n\nMaximum Time Frame\n\nThe undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\nThe graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\n\nCompletion Rate\nStudents must successfully complete a percentage of all attempted hours that is in line with completing their degree requirements within the overall maximum time frame for a degree program. This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student\u2019s overall successfully completed hours by the student\u2019s overall attempted hours.\nThe undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.\nUndergraduate Pace Rate:\nAttempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%\nThe graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.\nIncompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic\/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.\nTransfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student\u2019s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student\u2019s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.\nRepeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student\u2019s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student\u2019s cumulative GPA.\nStudents must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.\nFailure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards\nIn these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students\u2019 UT Dallas email address.\nStudent records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.\nAppeal Process\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid.

{"prompt":"withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the program?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq #va-ro 3\n processed.\u00a0 We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.\n\nAre there any fees that the VA will not cover?\nYes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the process for verifying household size and number of household members in college?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq #va-ro 3\n processed.\u00a0 We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.\n\nAre there any fees that the VA will not cover?\nYes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the COE?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"aid-programs 1\nWork-Study \n\nWhen you submit a financial aid application to the Office of Financial Aid, you are seeking help with funding your educational expenses. Some forms of funding do not have to be repaid, while student loans require repayment with interest, and work-study requires employment. Exemptions, waivers, and veterans benefits each have application processes outside of the general financial aid application process. The types of aid programs are listed below with more information.\nGrants\nGrants do not have to be repaid and are usually awarded based on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), as calculated using the data on your financial aid application, and your financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at The University of Texas at Dallas.\nStudent Loans\nStudent loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans and private loans.\nWork-Study\nWork-study is a form of financial aid that allows you to work, usually in an on-campus position, to earn the funding offered to you by the Office of Financial Aid. Work-study requires that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas. The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.\nExemptions and Waivers\nExemptions\nExemption programs provide funding that effectively exempt you from having to pay a portion or all of your tuition or, in some cases, your tuition and fees. Exemption programs are available for certain eligible students who are classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nWaivers\nWaiver programs are designed to waive the out-of-state portion of your non-resident tuition. Waiver programs are available for certain eligible students who are not classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nVeterans Benefits\nVeterans Benefits include federal and state funding programs for eligible veterans and service members and, in some cases, their spouses and dependents.

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq 3\n processed.\u00a0 We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.\n\nAre there any fees that the VA will not cover?\nYes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans private-loans 1\nPrivate Loan Repayment\n\nIt is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan. Private loans are usually more expensive than federal loans, so you and your family should consider obtaining a private loan only after exhausting your federal loan eligibility, including Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS Loans. Learn more information about the two options at the Federal Versus Private Loans website. You can also learn about the maximum amounts of federal aid that you may be eligible to receive by visiting the Federal Loans page.\nApplication Steps for a Private Education Loan\n\nChoose your lender\nComplete the lender\u2019s application process\nReceive funds from the lender\n\nTo assist you in completing the self-certification form, cost of attendance (COA) estimates can be found on the Office of Financial Aid Estimated Costs of Attendance page. Your personal COA can be found by logging into Galaxy. From Galaxy, you can locate COA information by clicking Orion, then Self-Service, and then Campus Finances. Finally, click View Financial Aid, select the aid year for the COA that you would like to view and then click the Cost of Attendance Summary link. You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in determining your COA.\nWhy We Are Providing This Information\nBecause many students and families are unsure of where to begin searching for a legitimate private education loan lender, the Office of Financial Aid compiles an annual list of private education loan lenders. The loans are presented using FASTChoice \u2013 an online tool designed to help you compare a few of your lender options side by side. Remember that you may choose any lender, even if the lender does not appear on our lender list.\nEach lender that appears on this list is required to provide important disclosure information to UT Dallas, prospective students and their families. This important information can be accessed through FASTChoice. If you are unable to access this important information, our office can provide you with an electronic or printed copy. Please contact a member of the loans team by telephone at (972) 883-2941 or by email at faloans@utdallas.edu.\nUnless otherwise stated, none of the lenders on this list are affiliated with one another.\nMethod and Criteria\nEach year, UT Dallas asks private education loan lenders to provide an overview of their loan products for consideration on our lender list. Each lender responds to the same survey that is created by the Office of Financial Aid. The survey requests information about each lender\u2019s practices in the following areas:\n\nBorrower Benefits or Incentives.\nBorrower Eligibility to receive loan funds.\nLoan Interest Rates.\nLoan Repayment Terms.\nLoan Servicing.\nLoan Processing Systems.\nLender History.\n\nEach lender response is reviewed by a committee with regard to the areas listed above.\nWhy Each Lender Was Chosen\nEach loan lender listed must meet all of the following criteria:\n\nNo origination or other fees, deducted from the loan proceeds.\nAll loan products with a minimum interest rate that does not exceed 3.75% as of the time that the lender list is published for the year.\nAvailability of deferment and forbearance options to aid borrowers who experience financial difficulty during loan repayment.\nAvailability of a \u201cBorrower Services Center\u201d that a borrower can contact to receive timely information about his or her private loans.\nAbility to conduct the loan application, school certification, and funds disbursement processes electronically to reduce the time it takes for the borrower to receive funding.\n\nLender List\nLenderWebsitePhone NumberDisclosuresCitizens Bankcitizensbank.com\/studentloans(866) 999-0254Citizens: Disclosure InformationCustom Choice Loan*funded by Citizens Bankcustomchoice.com(866) 232-3889Custom Choice: Disclosure InformationUnion Federal Private Student Loan*funded by Citizens Bankunionfederalstudentloans.com(866) 513-8445Union Federal: Disclosure InformationCollege Avenue Student Loanscollegeavestudentloans.com(844) 422-7502Disclosure InformationCommerce Bankcommercebank.com\/studentloans(855) 342-2006Disclosure InformationDiscover Bankdiscoverstudentloans.com(800) 788-3368Disclosure InformationKentucky Higher Education Student Loan Corporation (KHESLC)kheslc.com(800) 693-8220Disclosure InformationNelnet Banknelnetbank.com(800) 446-4190Disclosure InformationPNC Bankpnconcampus.com(800) 762-1001Disclosure InformationSallie Mae Banksalliemae.com(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationRandolph Brooks Federal Credit Union*funded by Sallie Mae Bankrbfcu.org\/studentloans(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationSoFi Banksofi.com\/private-student-loans\/(855) 456-7634Disclosure InformationTexas Higher Education Coordinating Boardhhloans.com(800) 242-3062Disclosure Information\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the process for appealing a financial aid suspension?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans private-loans 1\nPrivate Loan Repayment\n\nIt is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan. Private loans are usually more expensive than federal loans, so you and your family should consider obtaining a private loan only after exhausting your federal loan eligibility, including Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS Loans. Learn more information about the two options at the Federal Versus Private Loans website. You can also learn about the maximum amounts of federal aid that you may be eligible to receive by visiting the Federal Loans page.\nApplication Steps for a Private Education Loan\n\nChoose your lender\nComplete the lender\u2019s application process\nReceive funds from the lender\n\nTo assist you in completing the self-certification form, cost of attendance (COA) estimates can be found on the Office of Financial Aid Estimated Costs of Attendance page. Your personal COA can be found by logging into Galaxy. From Galaxy, you can locate COA information by clicking Orion, then Self-Service, and then Campus Finances. Finally, click View Financial Aid, select the aid year for the COA that you would like to view and then click the Cost of Attendance Summary link. You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in determining your COA.\nWhy We Are Providing This Information\nBecause many students and families are unsure of where to begin searching for a legitimate private education loan lender, the Office of Financial Aid compiles an annual list of private education loan lenders. The loans are presented using FASTChoice \u2013 an online tool designed to help you compare a few of your lender options side by side. Remember that you may choose any lender, even if the lender does not appear on our lender list.\nEach lender that appears on this list is required to provide important disclosure information to UT Dallas, prospective students and their families. This important information can be accessed through FASTChoice. If you are unable to access this important information, our office can provide you with an electronic or printed copy. Please contact a member of the loans team by telephone at (972) 883-2941 or by email at faloans@utdallas.edu.\nUnless otherwise stated, none of the lenders on this list are affiliated with one another.\nMethod and Criteria\nEach year, UT Dallas asks private education loan lenders to provide an overview of their loan products for consideration on our lender list. Each lender responds to the same survey that is created by the Office of Financial Aid. The survey requests information about each lender\u2019s practices in the following areas:\n\nBorrower Benefits or Incentives.\nBorrower Eligibility to receive loan funds.\nLoan Interest Rates.\nLoan Repayment Terms.\nLoan Servicing.\nLoan Processing Systems.\nLender History.\n\nEach lender response is reviewed by a committee with regard to the areas listed above.\nWhy Each Lender Was Chosen\nEach loan lender listed must meet all of the following criteria:\n\nNo origination or other fees, deducted from the loan proceeds.\nAll loan products with a minimum interest rate that does not exceed 3.75% as of the time that the lender list is published for the year.\nAvailability of deferment and forbearance options to aid borrowers who experience financial difficulty during loan repayment.\nAvailability of a \u201cBorrower Services Center\u201d that a borrower can contact to receive timely information about his or her private loans.\nAbility to conduct the loan application, school certification, and funds disbursement processes electronically to reduce the time it takes for the borrower to receive funding.\n\nLender List\nLenderWebsitePhone NumberDisclosuresCitizens Bankcitizensbank.com\/studentloans(866) 999-0254Citizens: Disclosure InformationCustom Choice Loan*funded by Citizens Bankcustomchoice.com(866) 232-3889Custom Choice: Disclosure InformationUnion Federal Private Student Loan*funded by Citizens Bankunionfederalstudentloans.com(866) 513-8445Union Federal: Disclosure InformationCollege Avenue Student Loanscollegeavestudentloans.com(844) 422-7502Disclosure InformationCommerce Bankcommercebank.com\/studentloans(855) 342-2006Disclosure InformationDiscover Bankdiscoverstudentloans.com(800) 788-3368Disclosure InformationKentucky Higher Education Student Loan Corporation (KHESLC)kheslc.com(800) 693-8220Disclosure InformationNelnet Banknelnetbank.com(800) 446-4190Disclosure InformationPNC Bankpnconcampus.com(800) 762-1001Disclosure InformationSallie Mae Banksalliemae.com(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationRandolph Brooks Federal Credit Union*funded by Sallie Mae Bankrbfcu.org\/studentloans(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationSoFi Banksofi.com\/private-student-loans\/(855) 456-7634Disclosure InformationTexas Higher Education Coordinating Boardhhloans.com(800) 242-3062Disclosure Information\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are some of the best resources for finding private scholarships?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are some of the best tips for finding and applying for scholarships?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need.

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits federal-benefits va-faq #va-ro 3\n processed.\u00a0 We will not release financial aid early to any student who cannot provide proper documentation.\n\nAre there any fees that the VA will not cover?\nYes. Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551).

{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans private-loans 1\nPrivate Loan Repayment\n\nIt is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan. Private loans are usually more expensive than federal loans, so you and your family should consider obtaining a private loan only after exhausting your federal loan eligibility, including Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS Loans. Learn more information about the two options at the Federal Versus Private Loans website. You can also learn about the maximum amounts of federal aid that you may be eligible to receive by visiting the Federal Loans page.\nApplication Steps for a Private Education Loan\n\nChoose your lender\nComplete the lender\u2019s application process\nReceive funds from the lender\n\nTo assist you in completing the self-certification form, cost of attendance (COA) estimates can be found on the Office of Financial Aid Estimated Costs of Attendance page. Your personal COA can be found by logging into Galaxy. From Galaxy, you can locate COA information by clicking Orion, then Self-Service, and then Campus Finances. Finally, click View Financial Aid, select the aid year for the COA that you would like to view and then click the Cost of Attendance Summary link. You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in determining your COA.\nWhy We Are Providing This Information\nBecause many students and families are unsure of where to begin searching for a legitimate private education loan lender, the Office of Financial Aid compiles an annual list of private education loan lenders. The loans are presented using FASTChoice \u2013 an online tool designed to help you compare a few of your lender options side by side. Remember that you may choose any lender, even if the lender does not appear on our lender list.\nEach lender that appears on this list is required to provide important disclosure information to UT Dallas, prospective students and their families. This important information can be accessed through FASTChoice. If you are unable to access this important information, our office can provide you with an electronic or printed copy.

{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans private-loans 1\nPrivate Loan Repayment\n\nIt is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan. Private loans are usually more expensive than federal loans, so you and your family should consider obtaining a private loan only after exhausting your federal loan eligibility, including Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS Loans. Learn more information about the two options at the Federal Versus Private Loans website. You can also learn about the maximum amounts of federal aid that you may be eligible to receive by visiting the Federal Loans page.\nApplication Steps for a Private Education Loan\n\nChoose your lender\nComplete the lender\u2019s application process\nReceive funds from the lender\n\nTo assist you in completing the self-certification form, cost of attendance (COA) estimates can be found on the Office of Financial Aid Estimated Costs of Attendance page. Your personal COA can be found by logging into Galaxy. From Galaxy, you can locate COA information by clicking Orion, then Self-Service, and then Campus Finances. Finally, click View Financial Aid, select the aid year for the COA that you would like to view and then click the Cost of Attendance Summary link. You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in determining your COA.\nWhy We Are Providing This Information\nBecause many students and families are unsure of where to begin searching for a legitimate private education loan lender, the Office of Financial Aid compiles an annual list of private education loan lenders. The loans are presented using FASTChoice \u2013 an online tool designed to help you compare a few of your lender options side by side. Remember that you may choose any lender, even if the lender does not appear on our lender list.\nEach lender that appears on this list is required to provide important disclosure information to UT Dallas, prospective students and their families. This important information can be accessed through FASTChoice. If you are unable to access this important information, our office can provide you with an electronic or printed copy.

For Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2014, the borrower will be responsible for paying any interest that accrues during the grace period.

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods.

Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major.

You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: When is the 50 percent point of the semester?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nCan I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?\nA:\u00a0Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.\n\nDo you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?\nStudents should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and\/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.\n\nHow do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?\nYou must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?\nThe law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA\u2019s topic on Dependency Status.\n\nMy parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?\nThere is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the \u201cWill Not File\u201d option. They will then be directed to the wages\/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.\n\nMy parents work out of the country. They don\u2019t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?\nIf your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.\n\nWho can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?\nIndependent students may only include their spouse and\/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.\n\nI completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven\u2019t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?\nWhen we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit\u00a0fafsa.gov\u00a0to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA.\u00a0If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application\u2019s status.\n\nI don\u2019t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan.

You may also visit our\u00a0Private Education Loans\u00a0page for information on private educational loans.\n\nDo I have to accept my loans again for the spring?\nIf, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.\n\nMy lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven\u2019t you received them?\nIt may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.\n\nWhen should I expect to receive my refund?\nPlease see the Bursar\u2019s Office\u00a0Refunds page\u00a0for information.\n\nWhere can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?\nAll of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).\n\nI need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet. What should I do?\nIf your financial aid application is complete and your funds have not disbursed by the first day of classes, you may be eligible for an on-campus book voucher.

{"prompt":"aid-programs exemptions-and-waivers 1\nExemptions and Waivers\nAn exemption is a type of financial assistance that exempts certain Texas residents from the payment of partial or full tuition and, in some cases, mandatory fees. A waiver is a type of financial assistance that allows certain nonresidents of Texas to pay the in-state tuition rate.\nIn order to qualify for many of the tuition and\/or fee exemptions or waivers, students must be enrolled in a UT Dallas academic program that is funded by the state of Texas. Undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA, and graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Additionally, resident undergraduate students must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar in accordance with Texas Education Code \u00a7 54.014. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not result in a warning or probation term. Students who do not meet these criteria and who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the\u00a0appeal form(pdf).\nTuition Exemptions\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the Financial Aid tile?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid satisfactory-academic-progress 1\nTo be eligible for financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on a qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (completion rate\/maximum timeframe) standard. \nGrade Point Average (GPA)\n\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for undergraduate students is 2.0.\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for graduate students is 3.0.\n\nMaximum Time Frame\n\nThe undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\nThe graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\n\nCompletion Rate\nStudents must successfully complete a percentage of all attempted hours that is in line with completing their degree requirements within the overall maximum time frame for a degree program. This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student\u2019s overall successfully completed hours by the student\u2019s overall attempted hours.\nThe undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.\nUndergraduate Pace Rate:\nAttempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%\nThe graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.\nIncompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic\/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.\nTransfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student\u2019s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student\u2019s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.\nRepeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student\u2019s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student\u2019s cumulative GPA.\nStudents must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.\nFailure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards\nIn these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students\u2019 UT Dallas email address.\nStudent records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.\nAppeal Process\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the petition and will contact the student when a decision has been made.

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the TASFA form?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits hazlewood-exemption hazlewood-faq 1\nWhat is the deadline to apply for Hazlewood?\nThe priority deadline for submitting all required documentation is\u00a0July 15\u00a0for the upcoming academic year. If we have received all required forms by the priority deadline, the exemption will be in place before the\u00a0Full Term Census Day\u00a0as noted in the\u00a0Academic Calendar. We continue to process late applications in the order they are received. However, applicants who submit documentation after the start of the term are strongly encouraged to consider making alternate payment arrangements with the Bursar\u2019s Office in order to meet the payment deadline. Late submission of documents may result in late fees and\/or cancelled enrollment. Applications and all supporting documentation may be submitted no later than the last day of class for any given term. Hazlewood is not retroactive to prior terms.\n\nIs there a minimum academic requirement?\nAll undergraduate and graduate Hazlewood recipients (Veteran, Legacy, and Dependent of 100% Disabled Veteran) must meet\u00a0cumulative GPA requirements\u00a0as defined by the Office of Financial Aid. Additionally, undergraduate students must not have completed a number of semester credit hours that is considered to be excessive as outlined in\u00a0Texas Education Code 54.014. Legacy Act students must be enrolled in a degree program and may not exempt more than the degree plan maximum hours.\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption benefits will not be processed for subsequent terms until the previous term\u2019s academic progress has been reviewed and continuing program eligibility has been verified.\nThe above GPA requirements are not applicable to the children and spouses of a MIA, KIA, or service-connected deceased Veteran.\n\nHow many hours do I need to enroll in to receive the Hazlewood Exemption?\nThere is no minimum course load required to receive the Hazlewood Exemption; however, if you are eligible, there are minimum requirements for both\u00a0financial aid\u00a0and\u00a0federal VA benefits.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop or withdraw from a course while receiving the Hazlewood Exemption?\nIf you drop a course before\u00a0Census Day\u00a0but remain enrolled in at least one other course, the hours related to the dropped course will not be charged toward your Hazlewood eligibility. However, if you drop or withdraw from a course(s) after Census Day, the hours related to the course(s) dropped will be deducted from your Hazlewood eligibility. If you withdraw from all courses after the final day to receive a 100% refund, you will be charged Hazlewood hours based on the\u00a0Payment & Refund Calendar.\nPlease note, dropping or withdrawing from a course may also affect your eligibility for financial aid and\/or federal VA benefits.\n\nIs there an age limit for the Hazlewood Exemption?\nIn order to maintain eligibility for the Legacy Program under the Hazlewood Exemption, a student must be 25 years or younger on the first day of the term for which the exemption is claimed (unless granted an extension due to a qualifying illness or debilitating condition). There is no age limit for a veteran or for the spouse or child of a veteran who was 100% disabled or deceased as a result of service-related injury or illness.\n\nAre any programs excluded from the Hazlewood Exemption at UT Dallas?\nExecutive education and certain certificate programs are not eligible for the Hazlewood exemption for the reason that the school does not receive state formula funding (tax support) for these programs.\n\nWhat is a Certificate of Eligibility for Federal GI Bill benefits (COE) and how do I get one?\nA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is an official correspondence from the VA stating your federal education benefits status. The certificate will state whether you have exhausted your eligibility for GI Bill benefits (Chapters 31, 33 [Post-9\/11]). COE\u2019s may be obtained by completing a\u00a0Online GI Bill\u00ae Application\u00a0or by calling 1-888-GI-Bill-1.\n\nI used the Hazlewood Exemption at another school. Do I need to complete another application?\nYes. State law requires all schools to maintain their own Hazlewood exemption records. Each school also is required to verify your attempted Hazlewood hours from all previously attended institutions.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and VA Benefits?\nA student may use Chapter 33 (Post-9\/11 GI Bill) or Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation) with Hazlewood during the same term if the combination of benefits does not exceed the total amount of tuition and fees. In either case, Hazlewood benefits may cover eligible tuition and fees that are not covered by Ch. 33 or Ch. 31 tuition and fees payments. A student may receive the full amount of federal education benefits issued under Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB, Chapter 30 & Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Post Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32) in conjunction with Hazlewood.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and other forms of financial aid?\nWhile the Hazlewood exemption may be used in conjunction with some other forms of financial aid, such as federal grants, outside scholarships, loans, and work-study, it must fit within your Cost of Attendance (COA) and contribute to your financial need, if applicable. Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only. Consequently, those funds may not be received in addition to the Hazlewood Exemption. If financial aid is already disbursed or awarded at the time your Hazlewood exemption is approved, adjustments may be made to your financial aid to allow for the exemption. Additionally, exemption amounts will be adjusted to allow for any federal VA education (Post-9\/11 GI Bill) benefits that are received.\n\nWhere can I find veteran services other than Hazlewood at the university?\nUT Dallas provides a full service\u00a0Military and Veteran Center\u00a0with resources for veterans, reservists, eligible dependents, and active duty military students.\n\nWhere can I learn more about the Hazlewood Act?\nWe encourage you to review the program guidance found on the\u00a0Texas Veterans Commission\u2019s website.

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the Veteran Exemptions and Waivers program?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

For example, if a parent becomes unemployed, disabled or deceased, the FAA can decide to use estimated income information for the award year instead of the actual income figures from the base year. This delegation of authority from the federal government to the financial aid administrator is called Professional Judgment (PJ).\nPromissory Note\nThe binding legal document that you must sign when you get a federal student loan. It lists the terms and conditions under which you agree to repay the loan and explains your rights and responsibilities as a borrower. It is important to read and save this document because you will need to refer to it later when you begin repaying your loan or at other times when you need information about provisions of the loan, such as deferment or forbearance.\nQ\nR\nRegular Student\nA student who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment at an institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized education credential offered by that institution. To be eligible for federal student aid, you must generally be a regular student.\nRepayment Schedule\nThe repayment schedule discloses the monthly payment, interest rate, total repayment obligation, payment due dates and the term of the loan.\nRetention Rate\nMeasures the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor\u2019s degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.\nRoom and Board\nAn allowance for the cost of housing and food while attending college or career school.\nS\nSatisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)\nA school\u2019s standards for satisfactory academic progress toward a degree or certificate offered by that institution. For more information see our satisfactory academic progress policy.\nScholarship\nMoney awarded to students based on academic or other achievements to help pay for education expenses. Scholarships generally do not have to be repaid.\nSelective Service\nRegistration for the military draft. Male students who are US citizens and have reached the age of 18 and were born after December 31, 1959 must be registered with Selective Service to be eligible for federal financial aid. If the student did not register and is past the age of doing so (18-25), and the school determines that the failure to register was knowingly and willful, the student is ineligible for all federal student financial aid programs. The school\u2019s decision as to whether the failure to register was willful is not subject to appeal. Students needing help resolving problems concerning their Selective Service registration should call 1-847-688-6888.\nShort Term Loan\nThe short-term loan is a payment plan that The University of Texas at Dallas offers to students enrolled in a full-term session for tuition and course-related fees. This payment plan will protect your classes from being dropped for non-payment. The short-term loan payment plan will only cover tuition and course-related fees. For more information, visit the Bursar\u2019s Office.\nService Obligation\nThe teaching service requirement set out in the Agreement to Serve (ATS) that you must sign to receive a TEACH Grant. By signing the ATS, you agree to teach (1) full-time (2) in a high-need field (3) at a low-income school or educational service agency that serves certain low-income schools, and (4) for at least four complete academic years within eight years after completing (or ceasing enrollment in) the course of study for which you received the grant.

You receive this report (often called the SAR) via e-mail a few days after your FAFSA has been processed or by mail within 7-10 days if you did not provide an e-mail address. If there are no corrections or additional information you must provide, the SAR will contain your EFC, which is the number that is used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid.\nSubsidized Loan\nA loan based on financial need for which the federal government pays the interest that accrues while the borrower is in an in-school, grace, or deferment status. For Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2014, the borrower will be responsible for paying any interest that accrues during the grace period. If the interest is not paid during the grace period, the interest will be added to the loan\u2019s principal balance.\nT\nTeacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant\nA federal grant that provides up to $4,000 per year to students who agree to teach for four years at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves students from low-income families and to meet other requirements. If the service obligation is not met, the grant is converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.\nU\nUnsubsidized Loan\nA loan for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status. Interest on unsubsidized loans accrues from the date of disbursement and continues throughout the life of the loan.\nV\nVerification\nThe process UT Dallas uses to confirm that the data reported on your FAFSA is accurate.

Information about UT Dallas graduate programs selected for the ACM by other states is available from the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies.\nFor residents of Texas looking to study out-of-state, the first step is to confirm that a comparable program at the same graduate degree level is not being offered at a Texas public university. For a listing of these programs, or for more information, visit the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Degree Board Program Search web site or email the ACM Coordinator or call at 512-427-6518. A number of programs are available at in-state tuition rates (those in-state rates applicable to the out-of-state where the graduate program is offered).\nTo apply for admittance into an ACM program, send a certification of Texas residency and a copy of the out-of-state university\u2019s unconditional acceptance letter into the graduate program, and mail to:\nAcademic Common Market Coordinator Academic Affairs Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board P.O. Box 12788 Austin, TX 78711 512-427-6518\nFor out-of-state residents looking to study in Texas, please contact the ACM coordinator at your home institution or home state.

{"prompt":"receiving-aid faq 1\nWhat is UT Dallas\u2019 FAFSA school code?\nOur school code is 009741.\n\nDo I have to complete a new FAFSA every year?\nYes. Please visit the\u00a0Deadlines\u00a0page for priority deadline information.\n\nDo I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid?\nYou may complete a FAFSA at any time; however, we cannot process an award until you are officially admitted to UT Dallas.\n\nMay I transfer my financial aid from my old school to UT Dallas?\nWhile your financial aid awards (grants, loans, etc.) do not transfer from one school to another, almost all schools in the United States use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as the application for financial aid.\u00a0 You can visit\u00a0studentaid.gov\u00a0and correct your FAFSA to include UT Dallas (school code 009741). UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nCan I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?\nA:\u00a0Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.\n\nDo you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?\nStudents should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and\/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.\n\nHow do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?\nYou must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?\nThe law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA\u2019s topic on Dependency Status.\n\nMy parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?\nThere is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the \u201cWill Not File\u201d option. They will then be directed to the wages\/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.\n\nMy parents work out of the country. They don\u2019t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?\nIf your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.\n\nWho can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?\nIndependent students may only include their spouse and\/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.\n\nI completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven\u2019t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?\nWhen we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit\u00a0fafsa.gov\u00a0to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA.\u00a0If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application\u2019s status.\n\nI don\u2019t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan. What other options do I have?\nIf your parent applies for and is denied a PLUS loan you may be able to borrow additional unsubsidized Direct Loan funds. You may also visit our\u00a0Private Education Loans\u00a0page for information on private educational loans.\n\nDo I have to accept my loans again for the spring?\nIf, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.\n\nMy lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven\u2019t you received them?\nIt may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.\n\nWhen should I expect to receive my refund?\nPlease see the Bursar\u2019s Office\u00a0Refunds page\u00a0for information.\n\nWhere can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?\nAll of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).\n\nI need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet. What should I do?\nIf your financial aid application is complete and your funds have not disbursed by the first day of classes, you may be eligible for an on-campus book voucher. Book vouchers can be obtained at the Office of Financial Aid in the Student Services Building (SSB). For more information on who qualifies, please see our\u00a0Book Voucher Policy.\n\nWhat is considered a special circumstance?\nA special circumstance is an event that causes a loss of\/significant reduction in income or extremely high medical bills not paid by insurance. Special circumstance forms can be found on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\nWhat types of situations qualify for a Dependency Override?\nPlease see the cover sheet of the Dependency Override Request form on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are the criteria for being included on the lender list?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student\u2019s overall successfully completed hours by the student\u2019s overall attempted hours.\nThe undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.\nUndergraduate Pace Rate:\nAttempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%\nThe graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.\nIncompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic\/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.\nTransfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student\u2019s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student\u2019s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.\nRepeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student\u2019s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student\u2019s cumulative GPA.\nStudents must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.\nFailure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards\nIn these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students\u2019 UT Dallas email address.\nStudent records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average.

Continue to monitor your UT Dallas email account after you have submitted documents. This is how we will contact you if additional clarification and\/or documentation is needed. As part of the verification process, we may correct information on your FAFSA based on the documentation that you submit.\n\nHow long does verification take?\nThe average processing time for verification is two to three weeks from the date we receive all of the requested documents.\n\nWhat kind of documentation is required if my FAFSA is selected for verification?\nThe Department of Education tells us what documents we are required to request and review as part of the verification process. The requested documentation can include tax information, verification worksheets, proof of high school completion, and\/or other documents that may be used to confirm the information reported on the FAFSA.\u00a0\n\nTax Information\n\nThere are two ways to submit a copy of your tax information to our office for the verification process. The first way to do this is to return to\u00a0the FAFSA website and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to transfer your or your parent\u2019s tax information directly from the IRS.\nIf you are unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool and you have been selected for verification, you will need to obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS. This can be done online at\u00a0www.irs.gov, by calling\u00a0800-908-9946, or by completing and submitting\u00a0IRS Form 4506-T\u00a0to the IRS by fax or by mail.\n\nTax Information for Special Cases\nCertain tax-filers may be unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool or obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS and\/or may be required to submit additional or alternate tax documentation for the verification process.

Copies of the verification worksheets can also be found on our\u00a0forms\u00a0page.\u00a0 Be sure to complete the form(s) for the appropriate aid year and to sign the form(s) with handwritten signature(s). We cannot accept typed signatures on verification documents.\n\nWhat is the deadline for submitting verification documents?\nVerification document submissions are accepted throughout the aid year. However, it is in your best interest to submit your documents as soon as possible. We will not offer you financial aid until the verification process has been completed.\nPlease note that it is possible to be selected for verification after you have been offered financial aid or after financial aid has been applied or disbursed to your account. When this happens you have 30 days to provide the requested documents. We may cancel the financial aid offered or disbursed if the requested materials are not submitted within this time frame.

{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans private-loans 1\nPrivate Loan Repayment\n\nIt is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan.

You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in determining your COA.\nWhy We Are Providing This Information\nBecause many students and families are unsure of where to begin searching for a legitimate private education loan lender, the Office of Financial Aid compiles an annual list of private education loan lenders. The loans are presented using FASTChoice \u2013 an online tool designed to help you compare a few of your lender options side by side. Remember that you may choose any lender, even if the lender does not appear on our lender list.\nEach lender that appears on this list is required to provide important disclosure information to UT Dallas, prospective students and their families. This important information can be accessed through FASTChoice. If you are unable to access this important information, our office can provide you with an electronic or printed copy. Please contact a member of the loans team by telephone at (972) 883-2941 or by email at faloans@utdallas.edu.\nUnless otherwise stated, none of the lenders on this list are affiliated with one another.\nMethod and Criteria\nEach year, UT Dallas asks private education loan lenders to provide an overview of their loan products for consideration on our lender list. Each lender responds to the same survey that is created by the Office of Financial Aid. The survey requests information about each lender\u2019s practices in the following areas:\n\nBorrower Benefits or Incentives.\nBorrower Eligibility to receive loan funds.\nLoan Interest Rates.\nLoan Repayment Terms.\nLoan Servicing.\nLoan Processing Systems.\nLender History.\n\nEach lender response is reviewed by a committee with regard to the areas listed above.\nWhy Each Lender Was Chosen\nEach loan lender listed must meet all of the following criteria:\n\nNo origination or other fees, deducted from the loan proceeds.\nAll loan products with a minimum interest rate that does not exceed 3.75% as of the time that the lender list is published for the year.\nAvailability of deferment and forbearance options to aid borrowers who experience financial difficulty during loan repayment.\nAvailability of a \u201cBorrower Services Center\u201d that a borrower can contact to receive timely information about his or her private loans.\nAbility to conduct the loan application, school certification, and funds disbursement processes electronically to reduce the time it takes for the borrower to receive funding.\n\nLender List\nLenderWebsitePhone NumberDisclosuresCitizens Bankcitizensbank.com\/studentloans(866) 999-0254Citizens: Disclosure InformationCustom Choice Loan*funded by Citizens Bankcustomchoice.com(866) 232-3889Custom Choice: Disclosure InformationUnion Federal Private Student Loan*funded by Citizens Bankunionfederalstudentloans.com(866) 513-8445Union Federal: Disclosure InformationCollege Avenue Student Loanscollegeavestudentloans.com(844) 422-7502Disclosure InformationCommerce Bankcommercebank.com\/studentloans(855) 342-2006Disclosure InformationDiscover Bankdiscoverstudentloans.com(800) 788-3368Disclosure InformationKentucky Higher Education Student Loan Corporation (KHESLC)kheslc.com(800) 693-8220Disclosure InformationNelnet Banknelnetbank.com(800) 446-4190Disclosure InformationPNC Bankpnconcampus.com(800) 762-1001Disclosure InformationSallie Mae Banksalliemae.com(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationRandolph Brooks Federal Credit Union*funded by Sallie Mae Bankrbfcu.org\/studentloans(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationSoFi Banksofi.com\/private-student-loans\/(855) 456-7634Disclosure InformationTexas Higher Education Coordinating Boardhhloans.com(800) 242-3062Disclosure Information\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the Expected Family Contribution?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"receiving-aid faq 1\nWhat is UT Dallas\u2019 FAFSA school code?\nOur school code is 009741.\n\nDo I have to complete a new FAFSA every year?\nYes. Please visit the\u00a0Deadlines\u00a0page for priority deadline information.\n\nDo I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid?\nYou may complete a FAFSA at any time; however, we cannot process an award until you are officially admitted to UT Dallas.\n\nMay I transfer my financial aid from my old school to UT Dallas?\nWhile your financial aid awards (grants, loans, etc.) do not transfer from one school to another, almost all schools in the United States use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as the application for financial aid.\u00a0 You can visit\u00a0studentaid.gov\u00a0and correct your FAFSA to include UT Dallas (school code 009741). UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nCan I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?\nA:\u00a0Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.\n\nDo you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?\nStudents should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and\/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.\n\nHow do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?\nYou must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?\nThe law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA\u2019s topic on Dependency Status.\n\nMy parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?\nThere is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the \u201cWill Not File\u201d option. They will then be directed to the wages\/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.\n\nMy parents work out of the country. They don\u2019t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?\nIf your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.\n\nWho can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?\nIndependent students may only include their spouse and\/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.\n\nI completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven\u2019t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?\nWhen we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit\u00a0fafsa.gov\u00a0to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA.\u00a0If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application\u2019s status.\n\nI don\u2019t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan. What other options do I have?\nIf your parent applies for and is denied a PLUS loan you may be able to borrow additional unsubsidized Direct Loan funds. You may also visit our\u00a0Private Education Loans\u00a0page for information on private educational loans.\n\nDo I have to accept my loans again for the spring?\nIf, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.\n\nMy lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven\u2019t you received them?\nIt may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.\n\nWhen should I expect to receive my refund?\nPlease see the Bursar\u2019s Office\u00a0Refunds page\u00a0for information.\n\nWhere can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?\nAll of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).\n\nI need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet. What should I do?\nIf your financial aid application is complete and your funds have not disbursed by the first day of classes, you may be eligible for an on-campus book voucher. Book vouchers can be obtained at the Office of Financial Aid in the Student Services Building (SSB). For more information on who qualifies, please see our\u00a0Book Voucher Policy.\n\nWhat is considered a special circumstance?\nA special circumstance is an event that causes a loss of\/significant reduction in income or extremely high medical bills not paid by insurance. Special circumstance forms can be found on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\nWhat types of situations qualify for a Dependency Override?\nPlease see the cover sheet of the Dependency Override Request form on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: Who is able to appeal a decision made by the Aid Appeals Committee?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are the requirements for undergraduate students to qualify for exemptions and waivers?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

If the student did not register and is past the age of doing so (18-25), and the school determines that the failure to register was knowingly and willful, the student is ineligible for all federal student financial aid programs. The school\u2019s decision as to whether the failure to register was willful is not subject to appeal. Students needing help resolving problems concerning their Selective Service registration should call 1-847-688-6888.\nShort Term Loan\nThe short-term loan is a payment plan that The University of Texas at Dallas offers to students enrolled in a full-term session for tuition and course-related fees.

{"prompt":"receiving-aid faq 1\nWhat is UT Dallas\u2019 FAFSA school code?\nOur school code is 009741.\n\nDo I have to complete a new FAFSA every year?\nYes. Please visit the\u00a0Deadlines\u00a0page for priority deadline information.\n\nDo I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid?\nYou may complete a FAFSA at any time; however, we cannot process an award until you are officially admitted to UT Dallas.\n\nMay I transfer my financial aid from my old school to UT Dallas?\nWhile your financial aid awards (grants, loans, etc.) do not transfer from one school to another, almost all schools in the United States use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as the application for financial aid.\u00a0 You can visit\u00a0studentaid.gov\u00a0and correct your FAFSA to include UT Dallas (school code 009741). UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nCan I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?\nA:\u00a0Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.\n\nDo you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?\nStudents should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and\/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.\n\nHow do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?\nYou must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?\nThe law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA\u2019s topic on Dependency Status.\n\nMy parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?\nThere is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the \u201cWill Not File\u201d option. They will then be directed to the wages\/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.\n\nMy parents work out of the country. They don\u2019t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?\nIf your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.\n\nWho can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?\nIndependent students may only include their spouse and\/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.\n\nI completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven\u2019t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?\nWhen we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit\u00a0fafsa.gov\u00a0to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA.\u00a0If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application\u2019s status.\n\nI don\u2019t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan. What other options do I have?\nIf your parent applies for and is denied a PLUS loan you may be able to borrow additional unsubsidized Direct Loan funds. You may also visit our\u00a0Private Education Loans\u00a0page for information on private educational loans.\n\nDo I have to accept my loans again for the spring?\nIf, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.\n\nMy lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven\u2019t you received them?\nIt may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.\n\nWhen should I expect to receive my refund?\nPlease see the Bursar\u2019s Office\u00a0Refunds page\u00a0for information.\n\nWhere can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?\nAll of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).\n\nI need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet. What should I do?\nIf your financial aid application is complete and your funds have not disbursed by the first day of classes, you may be eligible for an on-campus book voucher. Book vouchers can be obtained at the Office of Financial Aid in the Student Services Building (SSB). For more information on who qualifies, please see our\u00a0Book Voucher Policy.\n\nWhat is considered a special circumstance?\nA special circumstance is an event that causes a loss of\/significant reduction in income or extremely high medical bills not paid by insurance. Special circumstance forms can be found on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\nWhat types of situations qualify for a Dependency Override?\nPlease see the cover sheet of the Dependency Override Request form on our\u00a0Forms page.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What documentation is needed to prove eligibility?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only.

You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA.

If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office.

You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551).

{"prompt":"aid-programs 1\nWork-Study \n\nWhen you submit a financial aid application to the Office of Financial Aid, you are seeking help with funding your educational expenses. Some forms of funding do not have to be repaid, while student loans require repayment with interest, and work-study requires employment. Exemptions, waivers, and veterans benefits each have application processes outside of the general financial aid application process. The types of aid programs are listed below with more information.\nGrants\nGrants do not have to be repaid and are usually awarded based on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), as calculated using the data on your financial aid application, and your financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at The University of Texas at Dallas.\nStudent Loans\nStudent loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans and private loans.\nWork-Study\nWork-study is a form of financial aid that allows you to work, usually in an on-campus position, to earn the funding offered to you by the Office of Financial Aid. Work-study requires that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas. The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.\nExemptions and Waivers\nExemptions\nExemption programs provide funding that effectively exempt you from having to pay a portion or all of your tuition or, in some cases, your tuition and fees. Exemption programs are available for certain eligible students who are classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nWaivers\nWaiver programs are designed to waive the out-of-state portion of your non-resident tuition. Waiver programs are available for certain eligible students who are not classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nVeterans Benefits\nVeterans Benefits include federal and state funding programs for eligible veterans and service members and, in some cases, their spouses and dependents. Possible funding ranges from tuition and housing assistance to living allowances.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the Montgomery GI Bill\u00ae Active Duty (Chapter 30)?\n Related:","completion":" no"}
{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans federal-loans repayment 1\nDirect and PLUS Loan Repayment\nFor Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized loans, repayment generally starts after a 6-month grace period that begins the day after you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time status. Unless otherwise notified by your servicer, your first monthly payment will be due after your grace period ends. For PLUS loans, repayment begins once the loan has fully disbursed, but students and parents may be eligible for an in-school deferment; contact the loan servicer for more information.\nYou will be making your loan payments to your federal loan servicer, the company that handles the billing and other services on your federal student loan. You can find out who your servicer is and locate their contact information by logging into the Federal Student Aid website.\nIf you have trouble repaying your loans, you should contact your servicer as soon as possible. They can work with you to find the best option for your situation, including changing your repayment plan or requesting a deferment or forbearance. Deferment and forbearance may allow you to temporarily stop making or reduce your loan payments.\nThe following resources are good sources for information on repaying your federal student loans:\n\nExit Counseling \u2013 Completing a Direct Loan Exit Counseling session is required before you graduate, withdraw, or cease attending half-time. The session provides basic information on repaying your loans and informs you of your rights and responsibilities as a student loan borrower.\nYour Servicer \u2013 Maintaining contact with your federal loan servicer is essential throughout the repayment process and they can help with many of the details of repaying your loans. They are also your contact point if you should have trouble repaying your loans.\nStudentAid.gov \u2013 The \u201cMy Aid\u201d summary, accessed by logging into Federal Student Aid, provides detail on what kind of loans you have borrowed, the amounts of those loans, and provides you with your loan servicer\u2019s name and contact information. You can also find a variety of resources, including a repayment estimator and answers to many frequently asked questions about repayment on the Manage Loans section of the Federal Student Aid website.\n\nPerkins Loan Repayment\nThe grace period for Perkins loans is 9 months and the first payment will be due at the end of the grace period. Before you graduate, withdraw, or drop below half-time, you must arrange for an exit interview by calling 972-883-2296 or by contacting the loan servicer, Campus Partners, at 1-800-334-8609. If you have questions about repaying your Perkins loan or are having trouble making payments, you should contact Campus Partners at 1-800-334-8609.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What are the benefits available under this program?\n Related:","completion":" no"}
{"prompt":"aid-programs student-loans private-loans 1\nPrivate Loan Repayment\n\nIt is important that you pursue your best borrowing option. If you meet the eligibility requirements, the federal student loan programs are almost always a better option than a private education loan. Private loans are usually more expensive than federal loans, so you and your family should consider obtaining a private loan only after exhausting your federal loan eligibility, including Federal Direct Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Federal PLUS Loans. Learn more information about the two options at the Federal Versus Private Loans website. You can also learn about the maximum amounts of federal aid that you may be eligible to receive by visiting the Federal Loans page.\nApplication Steps for a Private Education Loan\n\nChoose your lender\nComplete the lender\u2019s application process\nReceive funds from the lender\n\nTo assist you in completing the self-certification form, cost of attendance (COA) estimates can be found on the Office of Financial Aid Estimated Costs of Attendance page. Your personal COA can be found by logging into Galaxy. From Galaxy, you can locate COA information by clicking Orion, then Self-Service, and then Campus Finances. Finally, click View Financial Aid, select the aid year for the COA that you would like to view and then click the Cost of Attendance Summary link. You may also contact the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in determining your COA.\nWhy We Are Providing This Information\nBecause many students and families are unsure of where to begin searching for a legitimate private education loan lender, the Office of Financial Aid compiles an annual list of private education loan lenders. The loans are presented using FASTChoice \u2013 an online tool designed to help you compare a few of your lender options side by side. Remember that you may choose any lender, even if the lender does not appear on our lender list.\nEach lender that appears on this list is required to provide important disclosure information to UT Dallas, prospective students and their families. This important information can be accessed through FASTChoice. If you are unable to access this important information, our office can provide you with an electronic or printed copy. Please contact a member of the loans team by telephone at (972) 883-2941 or by email at faloans@utdallas.edu.\nUnless otherwise stated, none of the lenders on this list are affiliated with one another.\nMethod and Criteria\nEach year, UT Dallas asks private education loan lenders to provide an overview of their loan products for consideration on our lender list. Each lender responds to the same survey that is created by the Office of Financial Aid. The survey requests information about each lender\u2019s practices in the following areas:\n\nBorrower Benefits or Incentives.\nBorrower Eligibility to receive loan funds.\nLoan Interest Rates.\nLoan Repayment Terms.\nLoan Servicing.\nLoan Processing Systems.\nLender History.\n\nEach lender response is reviewed by a committee with regard to the areas listed above.\nWhy Each Lender Was Chosen\nEach loan lender listed must meet all of the following criteria:\n\nNo origination or other fees, deducted from the loan proceeds.\nAll loan products with a minimum interest rate that does not exceed 3.75% as of the time that the lender list is published for the year.\nAvailability of deferment and forbearance options to aid borrowers who experience financial difficulty during loan repayment.\nAvailability of a \u201cBorrower Services Center\u201d that a borrower can contact to receive timely information about his or her private loans.\nAbility to conduct the loan application, school certification, and funds disbursement processes electronically to reduce the time it takes for the borrower to receive funding.\n\nLender List\nLenderWebsitePhone NumberDisclosuresCitizens Bankcitizensbank.com\/studentloans(866) 999-0254Citizens: Disclosure InformationCustom Choice Loan*funded by Citizens Bankcustomchoice.com(866) 232-3889Custom Choice: Disclosure InformationUnion Federal Private Student Loan*funded by Citizens Bankunionfederalstudentloans.com(866) 513-8445Union Federal: Disclosure InformationCollege Avenue Student Loanscollegeavestudentloans.com(844) 422-7502Disclosure InformationCommerce Bankcommercebank.com\/studentloans(855) 342-2006Disclosure InformationDiscover Bankdiscoverstudentloans.com(800) 788-3368Disclosure InformationKentucky Higher Education Student Loan Corporation (KHESLC)kheslc.com(800) 693-8220Disclosure InformationNelnet Banknelnetbank.com(800) 446-4190Disclosure InformationPNC Bankpnconcampus.com(800) 762-1001Disclosure InformationSallie Mae Banksalliemae.com(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationRandolph Brooks Federal Credit Union*funded by Sallie Mae Bankrbfcu.org\/studentloans(877) 472-5543Disclosure InformationSoFi Banksofi.com\/private-student-loans\/(855) 456-7634Disclosure InformationTexas Higher Education Coordinating Boardhhloans.com(800) 242-3062Disclosure Information\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How do I apply for or transfer benefits?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009.

{"prompt":"aid-programs 1\nWork-Study \n\nWhen you submit a financial aid application to the Office of Financial Aid, you are seeking help with funding your educational expenses. Some forms of funding do not have to be repaid, while student loans require repayment with interest, and work-study requires employment. Exemptions, waivers, and veterans benefits each have application processes outside of the general financial aid application process. The types of aid programs are listed below with more information.\nGrants\nGrants do not have to be repaid and are usually awarded based on your Expected Family Contribution (EFC), as calculated using the data on your financial aid application, and your financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at The University of Texas at Dallas.\nStudent Loans\nStudent loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, but other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans and private loans.\nWork-Study\nWork-study is a form of financial aid that allows you to work, usually in an on-campus position, to earn the funding offered to you by the Office of Financial Aid. Work-study requires that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas. The program encourages community service work and work related to your course of study.\nExemptions and Waivers\nExemptions\nExemption programs provide funding that effectively exempt you from having to pay a portion or all of your tuition or, in some cases, your tuition and fees. Exemption programs are available for certain eligible students who are classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nWaivers\nWaiver programs are designed to waive the out-of-state portion of your non-resident tuition. Waiver programs are available for certain eligible students who are not classified as Texas residents by the Office of the Registrar.\nVeterans Benefits\nVeterans Benefits include federal and state funding programs for eligible veterans and service members and, in some cases, their spouses and dependents. Possible funding ranges from tuition and housing assistance to living allowances.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the process for getting a campus job?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

Watch for listings on bulletin boards, ask departmental counselors, and check department website listings.\nMost importantly, be proactive and diligent in applying for scholarships. It takes a lot of work, but in the end all your efforts could pay off.\n\nWhat to Do if You Receive a Third Party Scholarship\nIf you receive a scholarship from an outside donor, make sure you follow these simple steps:\n\nRequest that outside scholarship checks are made payable to The University of Texas at Dallas.\nGive your donor your UT Dallas issued email address (e.g. abc123000@utdallas.edu) and ask to have it included with your award.\nHave the donor include a letter explaining the award terms when the scholarship check is sent to UT Dallas.\nMake sure to report any outside scholarships to the Office of Financial Aid.\nPlease mail scholarship checks to the Office of Financial Aid (contact information).\n\nDisclaimer\nStudents in search of scholarships may find some of these links helpful.

UT Dallas must receive the results of your FAFSA to determine your eligibility for financial aid.\n\nCan I receive financial aid at two schools at the same time?\nA:\u00a0Federal financial aid programs, except for the Pell Grant, do not have a restriction on receiving funds at more than one school at a time. These programs have a maximum that can be awarded to an individual student in a year. You are responsible for notifying both schools of what you are receiving aid at the other school. You may not receive more than the annual or aggregate maximum from any financial aid program.\n\nDo you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?\nStudents should complete a summer financial aid application to be awarded for summer. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through our forms page. If you completed a FAFSA for the fall and\/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another FAFSA for the summer.\n\nHow do I apply for a Pell Grant and other types of financial aid?\nYou must complete a FAFSA. UT Dallas does not require any other type of application for financial aid, except for the summer term.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t claim me on their tax return or pay any of my expenses. Why do I have to include their income on my FAFSA?\nThe law governing the federal student aid programs is based on the premise that the family is the first source of your support. The law provides several criteria that determine if you are considered independent of your parents for financial aid eligibility. Note: reaching the age of 18 or 21 or living apart from your parents does not affect your dependency status. To assist you with determining your status, visit FSA\u2019s topic on Dependency Status.\n\nMy parents do not file taxes, how can I fill out my FAFSA?\nThere is a section on the FAFSA where your parents can select the \u201cWill Not File\u201d option. They will then be directed to the wages\/earnings question where they can indicate how much they earned.\n\nMy parents work out of the country. They don\u2019t file U.S. tax returns. How do I indicate that on my FAFSA?\nIf your parents filed a foreign return, they will convert all figures to U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate that is in effect the day they complete the FAFSA. Daily exchange rates can be viewed at CNN.com, as well as others available on the internet.\n\nWho can I include in my household size? May I include my significant other?\nIndependent students may only include their spouse and\/or dependents for whom they provide more than 50 percent support during the year. Dependent students must include their parents and any persons for whom their parents provide more than 50 percent support during the year.\n\nI completed my FAFSA over four weeks ago, but haven\u2019t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?\nWhen we receive the results of the FAFSA we send an email letting you know that we have it. If you have not yet received this email, and you have been admitted to UT Dallas, you can visit\u00a0fafsa.gov\u00a0to check to see if you listed our school code (009741) on your FAFSA.\u00a0If you listed UT Dallas and you have been admitted you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application\u2019s status.\n\nI don\u2019t think my parents will be approved for a PLUS loan. What other options do I have?\nIf your parent applies for and is denied a PLUS loan you may be able to borrow additional unsubsidized Direct Loan funds. You may also visit our\u00a0Private Education Loans\u00a0page for information on private educational loans.\n\nDo I have to accept my loans again for the spring?\nIf, at the beginning of the school year, you accepted your loans for the fall and spring semesters, you do not need to accept them again.\n\nMy lender told me they sent my loan funds to you. Why haven\u2019t you received them?\nIt may take up to three business days for UT Dallas to receive electronic loan funds from lenders. If the funds are not disbursed at that point, you should contact us. Paper checks may take longer. You will be notified via your UT Dallas email account when we receive those funds.\n\nWhen should I expect to receive my refund?\nPlease see the Bursar\u2019s Office\u00a0Refunds page\u00a0for information.\n\nWhere can I get information on the loans that I have borrowed?\nAll of your federal loan information can be obtained by visiting the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).\n\nI need to purchase books, but my financial aid has not been disbursed yet.

Book vouchers can be obtained at the Office of Financial Aid in the Student Services Building (SSB). For more information on who qualifies, please see our\u00a0Book Voucher Policy.\n\nWhat is considered a special circumstance?\nA special circumstance is an event that causes a loss of\/significant reduction in income or extremely high medical bills not paid by insurance.

{"prompt":"maintaining-aid satisfactory-academic-progress 1\nTo be eligible for financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on a qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (completion rate\/maximum timeframe) standard. \nGrade Point Average (GPA)\n\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for undergraduate students is 2.0.\nThe minimum cumulative GPA requirement for graduate students is 3.0.\n\nMaximum Time Frame\n\nThe undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\nThe graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\n\nCompletion Rate\nStudents must successfully complete a percentage of all attempted hours that is in line with completing their degree requirements within the overall maximum time frame for a degree program. This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student\u2019s overall successfully completed hours by the student\u2019s overall attempted hours.\nThe undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.\nUndergraduate Pace Rate:\nAttempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%\nThe graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.\nIncompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic\/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.\nTransfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student\u2019s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student\u2019s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.\nRepeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student\u2019s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student\u2019s cumulative GPA.\nStudents must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.\nFailure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards\nIn these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students\u2019 UT Dallas email address.\nStudent records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.\nAppeal Process\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the petition and will contact the student when a decision has been made. The decision of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee is final.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: Who should borrowers contact if they have questions about repayment of their B-On-Time Loan or College Access Loan?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

For PLUS loans, repayment begins once the loan has fully disbursed, but students and parents may be eligible for an in-school deferment; contact the loan servicer for more information.\nYou will be making your loan payments to your federal loan servicer, the company that handles the billing and other services on your federal student loan.

They can work with you to find the best option for your situation, including changing your repayment plan or requesting a deferment or forbearance.

The session provides basic information on repaying your loans and informs you of your rights and responsibilities as a student loan borrower.\nYour Servicer \u2013 Maintaining contact with your federal loan servicer is essential throughout the repayment process and they can help with many of the details of repaying your loans. They are also your contact point if you should have trouble repaying your loans.\nStudentAid.gov \u2013 The \u201cMy Aid\u201d summary, accessed by logging into Federal Student Aid, provides detail on what kind of loans you have borrowed, the amounts of those loans, and provides you with your loan servicer\u2019s name and contact information. You can also find a variety of resources, including a repayment estimator and answers to many frequently asked questions about repayment on the Manage Loans section of the Federal Student Aid website.\n\nPerkins Loan Repayment\nThe grace period for Perkins loans is 9 months and the first payment will be due at the end of the grace period. Before you graduate, withdraw, or drop below half-time, you must arrange for an exit interview by calling 972-883-2296 or by contacting the loan servicer, Campus Partners, at 1-800-334-8609.

The costs listed on the accompanying insert are estimates, based on averages, to assist with the budgeting of college related expenses.\nAccepting or Declining Financial Aid\nSee utd.edu\/t\/5324 for directions and screenshots regarding how students may accept their financial aid offer via their Orion Student Center in Galaxy (utdallas.edu\/galaxy).\nPlease note \u2013 accepting Federal Direct Loans is a multi-step process:\n\nAccept, Reduce or Decline AidStudents may accept, reduce, or decline their federal loan offer via utdallas.edu\/galaxy. If they wish to borrow less than the amount offered, students are able to enter the amount they wish to borrow before accepting their loan. When making this decision students should keep in mind that loans offered for the academic year (i.e. fall and spring semesters) are credited equally between semesters.\nComplete Entrance CounselingEntrance counseling must be completed before students\u2019 Federal Direct Loan funds can be credited to their student account. Entrance counseling teaches borrowers about a variety of topics including their rights and responsibilities, the terms of their loan, and their repayment options. Entrance counseling can be completed at studentloans.gov.\nSign a Master Promissory Note (MPN)Students borrowing Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct Graduate PLUS Loan funds, can complete their MPN at studentloans.gov.\nComplete Informed Borrowing ConfirmationBeginning April 2020, all Direct Loan borrowers are required to complete the Informed Borrowing Confirmation process by logging in to studentaid.gov. This process requires student and parent borrowers to view how much they currently owe in federal student loans, and to acknowledge that they have seen this amount before a school can make a first disbursement of the first Direct Loan that a student or parent borrower receives for each new award year.\n\nParents interested in information regarding the Direct Parent PLUS Loan program should contact the Office of Financial Aid at financial-aid@utdallas.edu.\nReceiving Financial Aid\nAccepted financial aid is scheduled to begin crediting to enrolled students\u2019 accounts around the first day of class each semester. We recommend completing all acceptance steps as soon as possible before the first day of class.\nPlease note that only courses required to complete a student\u2019s degree program are eligible for financial aid.\nSatisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)\nAll students must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements as listed below to remain eligible for financial aid. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each semester, including those for which financial aid was not received.\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\n\nThe minimum requirement for undergraduate students is a 2.0 cumulative grade point average.\nThe minimum requirement for graduate students is a 3.0 cumulative grade point average.\n\nMaximum Time Frame\n\nThe undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\nThe graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\n\nPace\nStudents must maintain a completion rate each semester in line with the maximum time frame of their degree program.\nComplete information regarding our Satisfactory Academic Progress policy is available at utd.edu\/t\/5339.\nCareer Center\nThe UT Dallas Career Center offers career-related resources including assistance with searching for employment opportunities, internships, resume writing, interviewing skills, and on-campus job placement. Students interested in a campus job may apply via the Career Center. Students who have been offered Federal Work-Study may apply for both \u201con-campus\u201d and \u201cwork-study\u201d positions. Placement in an on-campus or work-study position is not guaranteed. Student workers are paid semi-monthly based on hours worked. Information regarding job opportunities and the application process can be found at career.utdallas.edu.\nWithdrawal and Repayment Information\nDropping, withdrawing, or failing to participate in courses may result in the reduction or cancellation of aid. Please carefully review the following page: utd.edu\/t\/5341.\nPlease view the Bursar\u2019s Office Payment and Refund Calendar on page two of each semester\u2019s Academic Calendar for tuition and refund policies: utdallas.edu\/academiccalendar\/.\nFinancial Aid Website\nWe welcome you to visit the Office of Financial Aid website (utdallas.edu\/finaid\/) where you will find additional information regarding the various UTD financial aid programs, scholarships, deadlines, and more.\nOther Helpful Links\n\nBursar\u2019s Office\n\u2013 student accounts, direct deposit, payment options\nutdallas.edu\/finance\/bursar\/\n\nConsumer Information\nutd.edu\/t\/5340\n\nUTD Dining\nnew.dineoncampus.com\/utdallasdining\/\n\nUniversity Housing\nutdallas.edu\/housing\/\n\nAN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY\/AFFIRMATIVE ACTION UNIVERSITY\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: When can I request a reconsideration?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the deadline for requesting a reconsideration?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the deadline to submit my documentation to UT Dallas?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

You may also find the list of requested documents by reviewing the\u00a0To Do List\u00a0in your Orion Student Center.\n\nHow do I submit my documents?\nYou may submit your documents by email attachment (PDF format preferred) to\u00a0financial-aid@utdallas.edu. You may fax your documents to\u00a0972-883-6803. You may also submit documents to our office in person, by bringing them to the first floor of the\u00a0Student Services Building\u00a0during\u00a0business hours.\n\nWhat happens after I submit my verification documents?\nAfter we have received all requested documents, we will review the information submitted and compare it with the data you reported on your FAFSA. Continue to monitor your UT Dallas email account after you have submitted documents. This is how we will contact you if additional clarification and\/or documentation is needed. As part of the verification process, we may correct information on your FAFSA based on the documentation that you submit.\n\nHow long does verification take?\nThe average processing time for verification is two to three weeks from the date we receive all of the requested documents.\n\nWhat kind of documentation is required if my FAFSA is selected for verification?\nThe Department of Education tells us what documents we are required to request and review as part of the verification process. The requested documentation can include tax information, verification worksheets, proof of high school completion, and\/or other documents that may be used to confirm the information reported on the FAFSA.\u00a0\n\nTax Information\n\nThere are two ways to submit a copy of your tax information to our office for the verification process. The first way to do this is to return to\u00a0the FAFSA website and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) to transfer your or your parent\u2019s tax information directly from the IRS.\nIf you are unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool and you have been selected for verification, you will need to obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS. This can be done online at\u00a0www.irs.gov, by calling\u00a0800-908-9946, or by completing and submitting\u00a0IRS Form 4506-T\u00a0to the IRS by fax or by mail.\n\nTax Information for Special Cases\nCertain tax-filers may be unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool or obtain a Tax Return Transcript from the IRS and\/or may be required to submit additional or alternate tax documentation for the verification process. Please see the information below for requested verification documentation in these special cases.\n\nMarried Filing Separate Returns: If you or your parents were married as of the date of completing the FAFSA but filed a separate return from your\/their spouse in the tax year used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Transcript for both tax-filers\n\nJoint Return Filed, No Longer Married: If you or your parents filed a joint return for the tax year used on the FASFA but were no longer married as of the day the FASFA was completed, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Transcript\nA copy of the IRS Form W-2 for you\/the parent listed on the FAFSA\n\nAmended Tax Returns:\u00a0If you or your parent filed an amended tax return for the tax year used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Transcript\nA signed copy of the IRS Form 1040X that was filed with the IRS\n\nFilers of Non-U.S. Tax Returns: If you or your parent filed a tax return in another country for the tax year used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA signed copy of the foreign tax return or the tax return transcript that is translated into English and has the monetary amounts converted into U.S. dollars\n\nVictims of Tax-Related Identity Theft: If you or your parent was a victim of tax-related identity theft for the tax years used on the FAFSA, submit:\n\nA copy of the IRS Tax Return Database View (TRDBV), obtained by calling the IRS\u2019s Identity Protection Specialized Unit (IPSU) at 800-908-4490\nA signed statement from the tax-filer indicating that they were a victim of tax-related identify theft and that the IRS has been made aware\n\nTax Filing Extension: If you or your parent has filed an extension with the IRS beyond the automatic six-month extension period for the tax year used on the FASFA, submit:\n\nA copy of IRS Form 4868\nA copy of the IRS\u2019s approval of an extension beyond the automatic six-month extension period\nIRS Verification of Non-Filing Letter\nCopies of W-2s for the tax year or, for a self-employed person, a signed statement certifying the Adjusted Gross Income and Taxes Paid\n\nVerification Worksheets\nWe may request verification worksheets from you to verify your\/your parent\u2019s household size, the number of household members in college, or to confirm that you or your parent did not and will not file a tax return.\u00a0 We will send a worksheet containing the requested information to your UT Dallas email address when you are selected for verification. Copies of the verification worksheets can also be found on our\u00a0forms\u00a0page.\u00a0 Be sure to complete the form(s) for the appropriate aid year and to sign the form(s) with handwritten signature(s). We cannot accept typed signatures on verification documents.\n\nWhat is the deadline for submitting verification documents?\nVerification document submissions are accepted throughout the aid year. However, it is in your best interest to submit your documents as soon as possible. We will not offer you financial aid until the verification process has been completed.\nPlease note that it is possible to be selected for verification after you have been offered financial aid or after financial aid has been applied or disbursed to your account. When this happens you have 30 days to provide the requested documents. We may cancel the financial aid offered or disbursed if the requested materials are not submitted within this time frame. If you are unable to submit your documents by the 30-day deadline, please contact your\u00a0financial aid counselor\u00a0to request an extension.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How do I view my financial aid offer?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA).

The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the maximum amount of a TEACH Grant?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the interest rate on a Direct Unsubsidized Loan?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

COA includes tuition and fees; housing and meals; and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and dependent care. It also includes miscellaneous and personal expenses, such as an allowance for the rental or purchase of a personal computer; costs related to a disability; and reasonable costs for eligible study-abroad programs. For students attending less than half-time, the COA includes tuition and fees; an allowance for books, supplies, and transportation; and dependent care expenses.Expected Family Contribution: A number used by your school to calculate the amount of federal student aid you are eligible to receive. It is based on the financial information provided in your Free Application for Federal student Aid (FAFSA). This is not the amount of money your family will have to pay for college, nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.Federal Work-Study: A federal student aid program that provides part-time employment while the student is enrolled in school to help pay his or her education expenses. The student must seek out and apply for work-study jobs at his or her school. The student will be paid directly for the hours he or she works and the amount he or she earns cannot exceed the total amount awarded by the school for the award year. The availability of work-study jobs varies by school.Grants and Scholarships: Student aid funds that do not have to be repaid. Grants are often need-based, while scholarships are usually merit-based. Occasionally you might have to pay back part or all of a grant if, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a semester.Loans: Borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Loans from the federal government typically have a lower interest rate than loans from private lenders. Federal loans, listed from most advantageous to least advantageous, are called Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Parent PLUS Loans. You can find more information about federal loans at StudentAid.gov.Direct Subsidized Loan: Loans that The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on while you\u2019re in school at least half-time, for the first six months after you leave school (referred to as a grace period*), and during a period of deferment (a postponement of loan payments).Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Loans that the borrower is responsible for paying the interest on during all periods. If you choose not to pay the interest while you are in school and during grace periods and deferment or forbearance periods, your interest will accrue (accumulate) and be capitalized (that is, your interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan).Parent Plus Loan: A loan available to the parents of dependent undergraduate students for which the borrower is fully responsible for paying the interest regardless of the loan status.Private Loan: A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, state agency, or school.Net Cost: An estimate of the actual cost that a student and his or her family need to pay in a given year to cover education expenses for the student to attend a particular school. Net price is determined by taking the institution\u2019s cost of attendance and subtracting any grants and scholarships for which the student may be eligible.For more information visit studentaid.gov.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the University of Texas at Dallas prohibited from doing in regards to lenders?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

Show your essay to an advisor, teacher, parent, or other trusted source who can critique your work. The Writing Center in the UT Dallas Student Success Center is another resource you may want to consider.\nMany departments at UT Dallas offer scholarships. Watch for listings on bulletin boards, ask departmental counselors, and check department website listings.\nMost importantly, be proactive and diligent in applying for scholarships. It takes a lot of work, but in the end all your efforts could pay off.\n\nWhat to Do if You Receive a Third Party Scholarship\nIf you receive a scholarship from an outside donor, make sure you follow these simple steps:\n\nRequest that outside scholarship checks are made payable to The University of Texas at Dallas.\nGive your donor your UT Dallas issued email address (e.g. abc123000@utdallas.edu) and ask to have it included with your award.\nHave the donor include a letter explaining the award terms when the scholarship check is sent to UT Dallas.\nMake sure to report any outside scholarships to the Office of Financial Aid.\nPlease mail scholarship checks to the Office of Financial Aid (contact information).\n\nDisclaimer\nStudents in search of scholarships may find some of these links helpful.

The costs listed on the accompanying insert are estimates, based on averages, to assist with the budgeting of college related expenses.\nAccepting or Declining Financial Aid\nSee utd.edu\/t\/5324 for directions and screenshots regarding how students may accept their financial aid offer via their Orion Student Center in Galaxy (utdallas.edu\/galaxy).\nPlease note \u2013 accepting Federal Direct Loans is a multi-step process:\n\nAccept, Reduce or Decline AidStudents may accept, reduce, or decline their federal loan offer via utdallas.edu\/galaxy. If they wish to borrow less than the amount offered, students are able to enter the amount they wish to borrow before accepting their loan. When making this decision students should keep in mind that loans offered for the academic year (i.e. fall and spring semesters) are credited equally between semesters.\nComplete Entrance CounselingEntrance counseling must be completed before students\u2019 Federal Direct Loan funds can be credited to their student account. Entrance counseling teaches borrowers about a variety of topics including their rights and responsibilities, the terms of their loan, and their repayment options. Entrance counseling can be completed at studentloans.gov.\nSign a Master Promissory Note (MPN)Students borrowing Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Direct Graduate PLUS Loan funds, can complete their MPN at studentloans.gov.\nComplete Informed Borrowing ConfirmationBeginning April 2020, all Direct Loan borrowers are required to complete the Informed Borrowing Confirmation process by logging in to studentaid.gov. This process requires student and parent borrowers to view how much they currently owe in federal student loans, and to acknowledge that they have seen this amount before a school can make a first disbursement of the first Direct Loan that a student or parent borrower receives for each new award year.\n\nParents interested in information regarding the Direct Parent PLUS Loan program should contact the Office of Financial Aid at financial-aid@utdallas.edu.\nReceiving Financial Aid\nAccepted financial aid is scheduled to begin crediting to enrolled students\u2019 accounts around the first day of class each semester. We recommend completing all acceptance steps as soon as possible before the first day of class.\nPlease note that only courses required to complete a student\u2019s degree program are eligible for financial aid.\nSatisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)\nAll students must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements as listed below to remain eligible for financial aid. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each semester, including those for which financial aid was not received.\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\n\nThe minimum requirement for undergraduate students is a 2.0 cumulative grade point average.\nThe minimum requirement for graduate students is a 3.0 cumulative grade point average.\n\nMaximum Time Frame\n\nThe undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\nThe graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.\n\nPace\nStudents must maintain a completion rate each semester in line with the maximum time frame of their degree program.\nComplete information regarding our Satisfactory Academic Progress policy is available at utd.edu\/t\/5339.\nCareer Center\nThe UT Dallas Career Center offers career-related resources including assistance with searching for employment opportunities, internships, resume writing, interviewing skills, and on-campus job placement. Students interested in a campus job may apply via the Career Center. Students who have been offered Federal Work-Study may apply for both \u201con-campus\u201d and \u201cwork-study\u201d positions. Placement in an on-campus or work-study position is not guaranteed. Student workers are paid semi-monthly based on hours worked. Information regarding job opportunities and the application process can be found at career.utdallas.edu.\nWithdrawal and Repayment Information\nDropping, withdrawing, or failing to participate in courses may result in the reduction or cancellation of aid.

For example, if a parent becomes unemployed, disabled or deceased, the FAA can decide to use estimated income information for the award year instead of the actual income figures from the base year. This delegation of authority from the federal government to the financial aid administrator is called Professional Judgment (PJ).\nPromissory Note\nThe binding legal document that you must sign when you get a federal student loan. It lists the terms and conditions under which you agree to repay the loan and explains your rights and responsibilities as a borrower. It is important to read and save this document because you will need to refer to it later when you begin repaying your loan or at other times when you need information about provisions of the loan, such as deferment or forbearance.\nQ\nR\nRegular Student\nA student who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment at an institution for the purpose of obtaining a degree, certificate, or other recognized education credential offered by that institution. To be eligible for federal student aid, you must generally be a regular student.\nRepayment Schedule\nThe repayment schedule discloses the monthly payment, interest rate, total repayment obligation, payment due dates and the term of the loan.\nRetention Rate\nMeasures the percentage of first-time students who are seeking bachelor\u2019s degrees who return to the institution to continue their studies the following fall.\nRoom and Board\nAn allowance for the cost of housing and food while attending college or career school.\nS\nSatisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)\nA school\u2019s standards for satisfactory academic progress toward a degree or certificate offered by that institution.

Male students who are US citizens and have reached the age of 18 and were born after December 31, 1959 must be registered with Selective Service to be eligible for federal financial aid. If the student did not register and is past the age of doing so (18-25), and the school determines that the failure to register was knowingly and willful, the student is ineligible for all federal student financial aid programs. The school\u2019s decision as to whether the failure to register was willful is not subject to appeal. Students needing help resolving problems concerning their Selective Service registration should call 1-847-688-6888.\nShort Term Loan\nThe short-term loan is a payment plan that The University of Texas at Dallas offers to students enrolled in a full-term session for tuition and course-related fees.

You receive this report (often called the SAR) via e-mail a few days after your FAFSA has been processed or by mail within 7-10 days if you did not provide an e-mail address. If there are no corrections or additional information you must provide, the SAR will contain your EFC, which is the number that is used to determine your eligibility for federal student aid.\nSubsidized Loan\nA loan based on financial need for which the federal government pays the interest that accrues while the borrower is in an in-school, grace, or deferment status. For Direct Subsidized Loans first disbursed between July 1, 2012, and July 1, 2014, the borrower will be responsible for paying any interest that accrues during the grace period. If the interest is not paid during the grace period, the interest will be added to the loan\u2019s principal balance.\nT\nTeacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant\nA federal grant that provides up to $4,000 per year to students who agree to teach for four years at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves students from low-income families and to meet other requirements.

{"prompt":"aid-programs veterans-benefits hazlewood-exemption hazlewood-faq 2\n to receive a 100% refund, you will be charged Hazlewood hours based on the\u00a0Payment & Refund Calendar.\nPlease note, dropping or withdrawing from a course may also affect your eligibility for financial aid and\/or federal VA benefits.\n\nIs there an age limit for the Hazlewood Exemption?\nIn order to maintain eligibility for the Legacy Program under the Hazlewood Exemption, a student must be 25 years or younger on the first day of the term for which the exemption is claimed (unless granted an extension due to a qualifying illness or debilitating condition). There is no age limit for a veteran or for the spouse or child of a veteran who was 100% disabled or deceased as a result of service-related injury or illness.\n\nAre any programs excluded from the Hazlewood Exemption at UT Dallas?\nExecutive education and certain certificate programs are not eligible for the Hazlewood exemption for the reason that the school does not receive state formula funding (tax support) for these programs.\n\nWhat is a Certificate of Eligibility for Federal GI Bill benefits (COE) and how do I get one?\nA Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is an official correspondence from the VA stating your federal education benefits status. The certificate will state whether you have exhausted your eligibility for GI Bill benefits (Chapters 31, 33 [Post-9\/11]). COE\u2019s may be obtained by completing a\u00a0Online GI Bill\u00ae Application\u00a0or by calling 1-888-GI-Bill-1.\n\nI used the Hazlewood Exemption at another school. Do I need to complete another application?\nYes. State law requires all schools to maintain their own Hazlewood exemption records. Each school also is required to verify your attempted Hazlewood hours from all previously attended institutions.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and VA Benefits?\nA student may use Chapter 33 (Post-9\/11 GI Bill) or Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation) with Hazlewood during the same term if the combination of benefits does not exceed the total amount of tuition and fees. In either case, Hazlewood benefits may cover eligible tuition and fees that are not covered by Ch. 33 or Ch. 31 tuition and fees payments. A student may receive the full amount of federal education benefits issued under Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB, Chapter 30 & Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Post Vietnam Era Veterans\u2019 Educational Assistance Program (VEAP, Chapter 32) in conjunction with Hazlewood.\n\nCan I receive both Hazlewood and other forms of financial aid?\nWhile the Hazlewood exemption may be used in conjunction with some other forms of financial aid, such as federal grants, outside scholarships, loans, and work-study, it must fit within your Cost of Attendance (COA) and contribute to your financial need, if applicable. Certain institutional scholarship and grant funds (such as the Educational Assistance Grant) are intended for tuition and fees only.

The disbursement of your financial aid could be delayed due to one of the following reasons:\n\nYour current enrollment status does not match the enrollment status we used to award your financial aid.\n\nYour original financial aid offer letter or email included the enrollment status we used to award your financial aid. If your enrollment status for the term does not match this enrollment status, please submit an Hours Adjustment Form.\n\nYou are not meeting the financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements.\n\nYour SAP status was determined at the end of your last term enrolled at UT Dallas.

More information regarding the book voucher.\nIf you are on warning or probation with the Office of Financial Aid in regards to your academic progress, the disbursement of your financial aid may be delayed until your grades from the previous term have been evaluated.\nThe financial aid award notice we send you contains information regarding your anticipated enrollment. For example, it indicates if the financial aid awarded is based on your enrollment as a full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, or less than half-time student. If your actual enrollment is different from how your financial aid was awarded, the funds will not be released to the Bursar\u2019s Office.

Some of these fees include late registration fees, reinstatement fees, any fees associated with room and board or travel costs for a field trip or study abroad program, excessive-hours fees, late graduation application fees, parking permits (exception: if you are using Chapter 31 \u2013 Veteran Readiness & Employment and your Counselor approves the fee), and 3-peat fees. Please note this list is not exhaustive. If you have a question about a fee you have been charged and whether or not the VA will pay it, please email\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI am receiving a scholarship, will this affect my benefits?\nIf you are receiving any scholarship that covers only tuition and fees and you are receiving Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae) benefits, then yes. Our office will deduct the amount reported to the VA by the amount of the scholarship received. This does not affect other benefits (housing stipend, book stipend, et cetera) as these are based off the amount of hours you are enrolled in, not the tuition and fees reported to the VA.\n\nHow many hours constitute what pay rate?\nThe following course load tables show the minimum amount of hours necessary to maintain each enrollment status:\nUndergraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester1296Long Summer (11 weeks)964Short Summer (8 weeks)643Half Summer (5 weeks)432\nGraduate HoursFull Time3\/4 Time1\/2 TimeFall\/Spring Semester965Long Summer (11 weeks)643Short Summer (8 weeks)432Half Summer (5 weeks)321\nIf you are using Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits, any enrollment that is 50 percent or less will qualify for tuition and fees only.\u00a0 For example, if you are enrolled in six hours as an undergraduate student for the Fall or Spring semester, the VA will pay for your tuition and fees\u00a0only. For current pay rates, consult the VA web site at\u00a0www.gibill.va.gov\/.\n\nCan I repeat a course?\nIf you do not pass or receive the required grade in a course that is necessary for your major, the VA will pay for that course to be retaken.\u00a0 However, if you wish to retake a course that you have successfully passed (say, to improve your overall GPA), the VA will not pay for that course.\n\nWhat if I am placed on academic probation or suspension?\nIf you are placed on academic suspension, your status will be reported to the VA.\u00a0If you cannot register for courses, you cannot receive any VA benefits at The University of Texas at Dallas until you regain satisfactory academic status.\n\nWhat happens if I decide to drop a class?\nYou must report ANY changes to your enrollment to our office, this includes drops, adds, withdrawals, and switching courses. You can do so by submitting an email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu. If you drop any or all of your courses after the last day to withdraw without a \u201cW,\u201d you will likely have to repay all benefits received for the course(s) to the VA. Please review the\u00a0Academic Calendar\u00a0for these dates. For further information please contact the VA \u2013 888-GIBILL-1.\n\nHow far back can I be certified?\nThe VA will fund certified enrollment as far back as one year from the time of your certification.\n\nWhat if my course(s) meets over several terms or does not meet over a standard term of enrollment?\nCourses are certified to the VA by the start and end dates for each course (including final exams). If you are certified in several terms (such as an overlapping six week, eight week, 12-week and 16-week session), each term length is certified individually and payment is resolved by the VA.\u00a0 For instance, if you enroll in nine hours for the regular fall term as an undergraduate, and then enroll in three hours for a second eight-week session, the VA will not consider you full-time until the second eight-week session begins when you are enrolled in 12 hours, which is considered full-time.\n\nCan I take a course at another school and still receive benefits?\nYes, as long as that course will fulfill a degree requirement for your degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Our office will need to send your other school a Parent Institution Letter.\u00a0 In order to do so, you must submit a copy of your registration summary as well as the contact information at your secondary school who should receive the letter.\u00a0 You can submit these via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nI want to change my major. What do I need to do in regards to my VA benefits?\nOnce you have officially changed your major, you must submit the new academic degree plan to our office. You may do so via email to\u00a0veteransbenefits@utdallas.edu, fax (972-883-2947) or by dropping it off at the front desk located on the first floor of the Student Services Building.\n\nDo I need to request certification each term I wish to use benefits?\nYes. You must fill out the online certification form.\u00a0Access instructions on how to do so. Please note the priority deadlines for each term. Although we continue to process certification requests received after these deadlines, we cannot guarantee the certification will be submitted to the VA before your posted payment deadline.\n\nHow can I find out how many months of remaining benefits I have?\nYou may contact the Department of Veterans Affairs (888-GIBILL-1).\u00a0 If you are using Chapter 33 (Post 9\/11), you may also use the\u00a0ebenefits\u00a0website.\n\nAm I eligible to transfer my federal VA benefits to my dependent and\/or spouse?\nContact the Department of Veterans Affairs to fill out the appropriate paperwork, 888-GIBILL-1 (888-442-4551). Only Chapter 33 Post 9\/11 GI Bill\u00ae benefits are eligible for transfer and the veteran must have been a member of the Armed Forces on Aug. 1, 2009. Typically, the veteran must also have transferred the benefits while on active duty.\u00a0There are additional requirements to qualify, so make sure to ask the VA about their policies.\n\nCan I use Hazlewood benefits with my VA educational benefits?\nIt depends.\u00a0If you are receiving Post 9\/11 (Chapter 33) benefits at 100 percent or using Chapter 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation), you\u00a0are not\u00a0eligible to use Hazlewood benefits simultaneously.\u00a0However, you can typically apply for the\u00a0Hazlewood Exemption\u00a0if you are using any other type of federal VA educational benefit.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: How do you receive the exemption?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"withdrawal-policy 1\nStudents who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester\nIf you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University\u2019s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar\u2019s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.\nThe federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.\nA calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.\nIn order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)\nThe Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually \u201cearned\u201d and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student\u2019s date of withdrawal from all classes.\nHow the calculation works:\n\nNumber of days attended \u00f7 Days in semester = percent of semester completed\nTotal $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $\nTotal $ disbursed \u2013 Earned $ = $ to be returned\n\nStudents who drop courses but still are enrolled\nEach federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.\nAdjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.\nStudents who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.\nStudents who fail all courses\nIf you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.\nOther information regarding withdrawing from classes\nThese regulations are not the same as the University\u2019s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester\u2019s Academic Calendar.\nPlease refer to the Bursar\u2019s Office Tuition & Fees page for important information about UT Dallas payment and refund deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: What is the eligibility criteria for the waiver?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

Residents of member states who are accepted for admission into selected out-of-state graduate programs may enroll on an in-state rather than out-of-state tuition basis. Programs are selected by the states annually. Information about UT Dallas graduate programs selected for the ACM by other states is available from the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies.\nFor residents of Texas looking to study out-of-state, the first step is to confirm that a comparable program at the same graduate degree level is not being offered at a Texas public university. For a listing of these programs, or for more information, visit the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Degree Board Program Search web site or email the ACM Coordinator or call at 512-427-6518. A number of programs are available at in-state tuition rates (those in-state rates applicable to the out-of-state where the graduate program is offered).\nTo apply for admittance into an ACM program, send a certification of Texas residency and a copy of the out-of-state university\u2019s unconditional acceptance letter into the graduate program, and mail to:\nAcademic Common Market Coordinator Academic Affairs Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board P.O. Box 12788 Austin, TX 78711 512-427-6518\nFor out-of-state residents looking to study in Texas, please contact the ACM coordinator at your home institution or home state.
