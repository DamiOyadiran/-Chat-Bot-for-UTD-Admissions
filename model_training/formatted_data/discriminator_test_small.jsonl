The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid.\u00a0\nStudents on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.\u00a0 A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.\u00a0 A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.\nPlease note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and\/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average. Undergraduate students in receipt of such exemptions must also not violate the state\u2019s excessive hours rule as defined in Section 54.014 of the Texas Education Code. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not have a warning or probation term. Eligibility is determined on a term by term basis, based on current cumulative GPA and excessive hours status. Students who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal process as detailed below.\nAppeal Process\nStudents who have extenuating circumstances may appeal a financial aid suspension by submitting a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal to the Office of Financial Aid. Appeal cover sheets are available on our forms page as well as in the Office of Financial Aid. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the petition and will contact the student when a decision has been made. The decision of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee is final.\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\nQuestion: \n Related:","completion":" yes"}
