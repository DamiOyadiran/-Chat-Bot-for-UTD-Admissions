Veteran Exemptions and Waivers
Veteran Benefits Forms

The purpose of this program is to provide an education benefit to the children of persons listed as missing in action or prisoners of war by the U.S. Department of Defense.
In order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:

Be a Texas resident.
Be 21 years of age or younger, or 25 years of age or younger and receiving most of your support from a parent.
Have documentation from the Department of Defense that your parent, who is classified as a Texas resident, is missing in action or a prisoner of war.
Enroll in courses for which UT Dallas receives tax support (i.e., a course that does not depend solely on student tuition and fees to cover its costs).

Additionally, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA and must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar.
The exemption covers tuition, service fees, lab fees, building use fees, and all other fees with the exception of room, board or clothing fees, or deposits in the nature of security for the return or proper care of property. No funds may be used to pay tuition for continuing education courses for which UT Dallas receives no state tax support.
Email the Office of Financial Aid for additional information, including how to apply for the exemption.
