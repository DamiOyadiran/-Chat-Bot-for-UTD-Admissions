The purpose of this program is to provide students who play taps at military funerals with a voucher for tuition reduction at certain institutions of higher education in Texas.
Students in grades 6 through 12 or at postsecondary educational institutions who sound “Taps” on a bugle, trumpet, or cornet during military honors funerals held in Texas for deceased veterans are eligible for the program.
A voucher in the amount of $25 is issued each time a student sounds “Taps” at a military veteran’s funeral. Vouchers may be used by the student to whom they are issued to pay for tuition and fees and are not transferable. Vouchers do not have an expiration date.
Students contact local licensed funeral home(s) to make arrangements to provide TAPS during funerals honoring military veterans. The funeral director provides the TVCTAPS (TAPS Certification) form which is completed and signed by the student (or parent or legal guardian if the student is under the age of 18) and the funeral director following the playing of TAPS. The student or parent then submits the form to the address printed on the bottom of the form. It is the student’s responsibility to maintain a record of vouchers earned through the TAPS Tuition Voucher program.
After receiving the TAPS Certification form, the Texas Veterans Commission will issue and mail a voucher to the student. Each voucher made out in the student’s name represents $25 reduction in tuition and fees at certain institutions of higher education in Texas. Submit the voucher to the Bursar’s Office. In order to use the voucher, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA and must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
