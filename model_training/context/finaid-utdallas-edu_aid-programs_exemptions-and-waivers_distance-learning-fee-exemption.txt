Veteran Exemptions and Waivers
Veteran Benefits Forms

The UT Dallas Bursar’s Office may exempt you from the payment of certain fees if it determines that:

You are enrolled only in distance learning courses or other off-campus courses of the institution.
You cannot reasonably be expected to use the activities, services, or facilities on which the fee is based.
The exemption of the fee will not materially impair the ability of UT Dallas either to service any debt on which the fee is based or to offer or operate the particular activity, service, or facility supported by the fee.

In order to qualify, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA and must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
