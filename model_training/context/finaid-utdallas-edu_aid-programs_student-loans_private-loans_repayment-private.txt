Private Loan Repayment

You should contact your private education loan lender or servicer for details regarding the repayment of your private education loan(s). Generally, private loan lenders do allow for a grace period, but not always, so it is important to check with your lender to verify when repayment begins. If you encounter trouble repaying your private loans, contact your private loan lender or servicer as soon as possible for assistance.
