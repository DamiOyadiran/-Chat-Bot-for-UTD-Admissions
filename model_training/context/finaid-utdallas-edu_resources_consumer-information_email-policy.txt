The University of Texas at Dallas encourages UT Dallas personnel to send all official student email correspondence only to a student’s UT Dallas email/NetID address in an effort to protect the privacy rights of all students.
UT Dallas furnishes each student a Network ID (NetID) linked to an email account. The Department of Information Resources provides a method for students to forward their UT Dallas email to other personal or business email accounts. To activate or maintain a UT Dallas computer account and/or to set email forwarding options, visit the NetID Website.
The Office of Financial Aid sends all electronic correspondence only to a student’s UT Dallas email address and requires that all official electronic correspondence with the Office of Financial Aid be transmitted from the student’s UT Dallas email account. This requirement allows University personnel to maintain a high degree of confidence in the identity of the individual and in the security of the transmitted information.
Adopted: 23 August 2004
