To be eligible for state student financial aid you must:

Be a Texas resident or qualify to pay in-state tuition, depending on program requirements.
Be registered for the Selective Service unless exempt from registration.

College Access Loan (CAL)
The College Access Loan (CAL) Program provides alternative educational loans to Texas students who are unable to meet the cost of attendance. The CAL may be used to cover part or all of the student’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Students do not have to demonstrate financial need. However, the amount of federal aid for which you are eligible must be deducted from the cost of attendance in determining the CAL loan amount.
To be eligible, you must:

Be a Texas resident.
Be enrolled at least half-time in:

A course of study leading to an associate’s, bachelor’s, graduate, or higher degree; or
An approved alternative educator certification program.

Meet the satisfactory academic progress requirements as determined by UT Dallas.
Be registered for the Selective Service unless exempt from registration (www.sss.gov)
Receive a favorable credit evaluation or provide a cosigner who has good credit standing and meets other requirements.

Annual Loan Amounts
Students may borrow no less than $100 and up to the cost of attendance minus any other financial aid.
Note: The amount of any federal Direct Stafford loan (inclusive of subsidized and unsubsidized) that a student borrower is eligible to receive must be considered “other financial aid” even if the student chooses to not borrow funds from this program.
The CAL has a fixed annual interest rate of 5.35%. Interest is not capitalized.
