For information regarding the repayment of your B-On-Time Loan or College Access Loan, you will need to contact the Texas High Education Coordinating Board (THECB) at 1-800-242-3062 or 512-427-6340, if calling from the Austin Metro area. They can offer guidance on when and how to make payments, as well as offer assistance should you encounter trouble repaying your state loans.
