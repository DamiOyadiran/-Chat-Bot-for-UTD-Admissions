Veteran Exemptions and Waivers
Veteran Benefits Forms

The purpose of this program is to provide reduced tuition rate for individuals who are residents of states other than Texas who enroll in certain public universities in Texas. At UT Dallas, the waiver allows students who are residents of Oklahoma to pay the in-state tuition cost plus $30 per credit hour.
In order to be eligible for the waiver at UT Dallas, you must be an Oklahoma resident working on your first bachelor’s degree or your graduate degree. If you maintain Oklahoma residency, you can use the waiver until you graduate with your first bachelor’s degree or your graduate degree. To be considered for the waiver, contact the Office of Financial Aid regarding proof of your Oklahoma residency.
