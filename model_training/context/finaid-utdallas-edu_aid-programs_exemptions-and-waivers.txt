Exemptions and Waivers
An exemption is a type of financial assistance that exempts certain Texas residents from the payment of partial or full tuition and, in some cases, mandatory fees. A waiver is a type of financial assistance that allows certain nonresidents of Texas to pay the in-state tuition rate.
In order to qualify for many of the tuition and/or fee exemptions or waivers, students must be enrolled in a UT Dallas academic program that is funded by the state of Texas. Undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA, and graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Additionally, resident undergraduate students must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar in accordance with Texas Education Code § 54.014. The review of eligibility for state exemptions and waivers is performed on a term basis and does not result in a warning or probation term. Students who do not meet these criteria and who have extenuating circumstances may appeal using the appeal form(pdf).
