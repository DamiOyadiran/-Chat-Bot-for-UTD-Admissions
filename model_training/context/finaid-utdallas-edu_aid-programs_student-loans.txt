Student loans are financial aid that you and, in some cases, your parents borrow and repay with interest. Some student loans require that you demonstrate financial need, which is determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your estimated cost of attendance at UT Dallas, while other student loans do not require you to have financial need. There are three major categories of student loans: federal loans, state loans, and private loans.
