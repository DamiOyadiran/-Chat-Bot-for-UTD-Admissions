Veteran Exemptions and Waivers
Veteran Benefits Forms

The purpose of this program is to help enable blind and deaf students to attend public colleges or universities in the state of Texas. The exemption covers all dues, fees, and enrollment charges whatsoever for which exemptions may be lawfully made, including fees for correspondence courses, general property deposit fees, and student service fees (with the exception of fees or charges for lodging, board, or clothing). No funds may be used to pay tuition for continuing education classes for which UT Dallas receives no state tax support.
In order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:

Be a Texas resident.
Declare a program of study at the time you apply for the exemption.
Provide certification from the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services of your status as a blind or deaf person.
Enroll in courses for which UT Dallas receives state tax support (i.e., a course that does not depend solely on student tuition and fees to cover its costs).

Additionally, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA and must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
To apply for the exemption, you must provide the Office of Financial Aid with the following:

Certification from the Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services of your status as a blind or deaf person
A written statement of purpose indicating which certificate, degree program, or professional enhancement will be pursued
A copy of your high school transcript
A letter of recommendation from your high school principal, a public official, or some other responsible person who knows you and is willing to serve as a reference
