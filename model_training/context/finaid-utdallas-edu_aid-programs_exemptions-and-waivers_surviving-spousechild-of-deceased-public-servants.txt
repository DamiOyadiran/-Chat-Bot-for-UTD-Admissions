The purpose of the program is to provide free tuition and fees, free textbooks, and possibly free room and board to certain students whose parent or spouse was killed in the line of duty on or after September 1, 2000, while employed in certain public service positions.
In order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:

Be a surviving spouse or a surviving minor child of certain public employees.
Be enrolled full-time.

Additionally, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA and must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
Eligible students are exempted from the payment of all tuition and fees. In addition, UT Dallas will provide an allowance for textbooks. If you are eligible to live in on-campus housing, UT Dallas will provide you either free room or board, or if no on-campus housing is available, the University will provide you a room and board stipend equal to the amount you could have received if living on-campus. No funds may be used to pay tuition for continuing education courses for which UT Dallas receives no state tax support.
Contact the Office of Financial Aid for information on claiming this exemption. You must be able to provide proof of meeting the program’s eligibility requirements, as outlined above.
