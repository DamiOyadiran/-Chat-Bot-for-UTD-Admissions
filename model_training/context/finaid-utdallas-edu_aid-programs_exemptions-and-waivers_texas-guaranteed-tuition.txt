The Texas Guaranteed Tuition Plan (formerly the Texas Tomorrow Fund) is a pre-paid college savings plan. The purpose of this program is to pay for your undergraduate tuition and campus-wide required fees for each academic term in which you are enrolled until your benefits are depleted.
For eligible nonresident students, there are two components to the program: a waiver of nonresident tuition and an exemption of the remaining in-state tuition and fees.
The signed Texas Tomorrow card along with a form of identification must be brought to the Bursar’s Office in order to apply the payment to your tuition and fees.
