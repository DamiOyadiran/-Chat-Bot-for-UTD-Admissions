Texas is one of sixteen states participating in the Academic Common Market (ACM), an interstate agreement for sharing state-supported graduate programs. Residents of member states who are accepted for admission into selected out-of-state graduate programs may enroll on an in-state rather than out-of-state tuition basis. Programs are selected by the states annually. Information about UT Dallas graduate programs selected for the ACM by other states is available from the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies.
For residents of Texas looking to study out-of-state, the first step is to confirm that a comparable program at the same graduate degree level is not being offered at a Texas public university. For a listing of these programs, or for more information, visit the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Degree Board Program Search web site or email the ACM Coordinator or call at 512-427-6518. A number of programs are available at in-state tuition rates (those in-state rates applicable to the out-of-state where the graduate program is offered).
To apply for admittance into an ACM program, send a certification of Texas residency and a copy of the out-of-state university’s unconditional acceptance letter into the graduate program, and mail to:
Academic Common Market Coordinator Academic Affairs Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board P.O. Box 12788 Austin, TX 78711 512-427-6518
For out-of-state residents looking to study in Texas, please contact the ACM coordinator at your home institution or home state. The contact information for each participating state can be found on the Southern Regional Education Board web site.
