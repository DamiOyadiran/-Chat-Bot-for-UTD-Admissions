The purpose of this program is to provide an immediate waiver of nonresident tuition to the veteran, spouse, and dependent children who move to Texas.
In order to be eligible for this waiver, the veteran must:

Submit to the Office of Financial Aid a letter of intent to establish residence in Texas.
Reside in Texas while enrolled in the institution.
Be eligible for benefits under the federal Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (38 U.S.C. Section 3301 et seq.) or any other federal law authorizing educational benefits for veterans.

If you are the spouse of the veteran or the child (biological child, step-child, adopted child, or claimed as a dependent by the veteran for federal income tax purposes in the previous or current year) of the veteran, the veteran must meet the above criteria. The child must be 25 years of age or younger on the first day of the semester or other academic term for which he or she registers.
This program permits nonresident students to pay tuition and fees at the resident rate. Contact the Veterans Benefits Team to begin the application process. The letter of intent is required at the time the student uses his or her first waiver. If continuation waivers are awarded, the veteran’s continued eligibility for federal veterans benefits will be monitored, as will the age of the child, if the student is the child of the veteran.
