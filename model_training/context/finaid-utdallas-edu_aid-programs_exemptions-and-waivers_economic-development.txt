The Economic Development and Diversification In-state Tuition Incentive may be offered by the Economic Development & Tourism division of the Office of the Governor to qualified businesses that are in the decision-making process to relocate or expand their operations into Texas. The incentive allows employees and family members of the qualified businesses to pay the Texas resident tuition rate at a Texas public institution of higher education without first establishing residency if the business became established as part of the state’s Economic Development and Diversification Program not earlier than five years before the relevant enrollment date.

In order to be eligible for the waiver, you must:

Be a nonresident person (including a citizen, a permanent resident of the U.S., a person who is eligible to be a permanent resident of the U.S., and an eligible nonimmigrant) whose family has been transferred to Texas by a company established as part of the state’s Economic Development and Diversification Program not earlier than five years before the relevant enrollment date.

Your spouse and children shall pay resident tuition as soon as they move to Texas, if you provide the Office of Financial Aid with a letter of intent to establish Texas as your home.

A person who moves to Texas to attend an institution before his or her family is transferred is permitted to pay the resident tuition beginning with the first semester or term after the family moves to the state. After your family has maintained a residence in Texas for 12 months, you may request a change in classification in order to pay resident tuition.
Submit to the Office of Financial Aid documentation verifying your employment with an approved company in order to be considered for the waiver.
