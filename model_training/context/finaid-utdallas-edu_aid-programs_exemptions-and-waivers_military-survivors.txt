The purpose of this program is to provide a waiver of nonresident tuition to the spouse and/or children of non-Texas members of the U.S. Armed Forces and Commissioned Officers of the Public Health Service who died or were killed while in service if the spouse or child becomes a Texas resident. To qualify, the spouse or child must move to Texas within 60 days of the date of the death of the service member. (The parent is not required to relocate to Texas with the child for the child to qualify for the waiver.)
This program permits nonresident students to pay tuition and fees at the resident rate. Contact the Veterans Benefits Team to begin the application process. You must provide proof that you meet the program eligibility requirements.
