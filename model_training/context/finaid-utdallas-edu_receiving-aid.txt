The financial aid process begins with the application. You should submit either the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA). The TASFA is submitted by students who are considered to be a resident of Texas but who are not able to complete the FAFSA because they are not a citizen of the United States or an eligible non-citizen. Additional eligibility information is available.
Once you have been offered admission to UT Dallas we will evaluate your application.  We may request additional information from you. You can check “Tasks” in Orion to see if we have any outstanding requests.
Once we have sent you a financial aid offer you can accept or decline the aid in Orion. In Orion you click on the “Financial Aid” tile. On the left side of the screen you will see a link to “Accept/Decline Awards”. At the top left of that page you click on Accept/Decline. If you want to reduce the amount of a loan you have been offered you can change the value of the loan.
We begin disbursing financial aid on or about the first day of the term. If you have accepted your aid and meet the requirements to receive it we will disburse your aid and credit it to your account in the Bursar’s Office. If the financial aid disbursed exceeds what you are being charged by the Bursar’s Office the Bursar will send you a refund. You can have the funds sent directly to your bank by signing up for direct deposit in EZPay.
