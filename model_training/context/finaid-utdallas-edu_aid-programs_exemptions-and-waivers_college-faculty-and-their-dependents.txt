Veteran Exemptions and Waivers
Veteran Benefits Forms

The purpose of this program is to provide a waiver of nonresident tuition to teachers and professors employed at least half-time on a regular monthly salary basis by any Texas public college or university. Such a waiver is also applicable to the spouse and dependent children of the teacher or professor.
You are eligible if you are a student who is nonresident faculty or who is the nonresident, dependent child or spouse of faculty who is employed at least half-time on a regular monthly salary basis by any Texas public college or university. 
The value of the waiver is the difference between the nonresident and resident tuition rates and is effective for as long as the faculty remains employed in the above capacity. Please note that the waiver does not apply to non-state funded programs.
To be considered for the waiver, submit to the Office of Financial Aid a statement, prior to the time of enrollment, certifying employment of self, parent, or spouse as a teacher or professor in a Texas public college or university in at least a half-time capacity on a regular monthly salaried basis. Such a statement should come from the director of personnel or a designated representative of the employing institution. Additionally, spouses must submit a marriage license, and dependent children must submit proof of dependency in the form of a birth certificate or a copy of the parent’s most recent tax return showing the student claimed as dependent.
