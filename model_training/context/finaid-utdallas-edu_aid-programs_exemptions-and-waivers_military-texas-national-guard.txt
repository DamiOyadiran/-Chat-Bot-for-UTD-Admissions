Exemptions and Waivers
The purpose of this program is to provide an exemption from the payment of tuition to certain members of the Texas National Guard, Texas Air Guard, or the State Guard.
In order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:

Be a Texas resident.
Register for the Selective Service or be exempt from this requirement.
Be an active, drilling member of the Texas National Guard, Texas Air Guard, or the State Guard.

Individual awards are for your tuition charges (based on the resident rate) for up to 12 semester credit hours in a semester. If you take more than 12 hours, a source other than this program must be used to pay for the additional hours.
To begin the application process, you should contact the unit commander of your National Guard, Air Guard, or State Guard unit or the Education Officer at the State Adjutant General’s Office at 512-782-5515 or send an e-mail to education.office@tx.ngb.army.mil. The Education Office will provide instructions.
