Scholarships are sometimes referred to as “gift aid” because they provide funding that does not have to be repaid. Generally, scholarships are awarded based on merit but some may also require that the student demonstrate financial need. Scholarships are considered a resource. If you receive a scholarship or any financial assistance that is not listed in your award notice, federal regulations require that you report it to the Office of Financial Aid. We will then review and, if necessary, recalculate your overall aid eligibility.
