Note: The priority deadline for Comet Promise and  all Texas state financial aid programs is January 15. This includes the TEXAS Grant program and applies to all new and continuing students. Please see the Comet Promise and College for All Texans pages for additional details. 

To meet the financial aid priority deadline, you must:

Have submitted a valid FAFSA or TASFA (if you are not eligible for federal student financial aid) with the results received by UT Dallas. To ensure timely delivery, you should submit your application at least two weeks before the priority deadline. This allows time for you to receive and respond to a request for additional information.
Have been admitted to or be currently enrolled in a degree-seeking program at the University.
Supply additional documentation required, if any, for the completion of your application. You should log in to Orion to check for any outstanding financial aid documents. If you are a new UT Dallas student, you will be sent a letter notifying you of any missing financial aid documents; all reminders after this letter will be sent to your UT Dallas email address. You should regularly check your “To Do List” through Orion for any outstanding documents.

After the Priority Deadline
You may still complete a FAFSA or TASFA if you do not meet the priority deadline. However, FAFSA and TASFA applications should be submitted at least three weeks before the end of the term in which you are enrolled to allow time for processing.
Students who do not meet our priority deadlines risk not being considered for financial aid programs that are subject to annual appropriations. You will still be considered for the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Direct Stafford Loan and Federal Direct PLUS Loan programs.
