The purpose of the program is to provide a benefit to persons who were injured in the line of duty while serving as peace officers. The maximum award is an exemption from the payment of tuition and required fees for no more than 12 semesters or sessions.

Additionally, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA and must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
You may not receive this exemption if you are enrolled in a master’s degree program or are attending postgraduate courses to meet the requirements of a master’s degree program, and you have previously received a master’s degree and received this exemption for a semester or session while attending a postgraduate course to meet the requirements of that master’s degree program.
You may not receive this exemption if you are enrolled in a doctoral degree program or are attending postgraduate courses to meet the requirements of a doctoral degree program, and you have previously received a doctoral degree and received this exemption for a semester or session while attending a postgraduate course to meet the requirements of that doctoral degree program.
