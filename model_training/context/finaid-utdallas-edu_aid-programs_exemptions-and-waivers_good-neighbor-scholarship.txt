Veteran Exemptions and Waivers
Veteran Benefits Forms

The purpose of this program is to provide assistance for tuition to students from other nations of the Western Hemisphere (other than Cuba). The waiver covers one year of tuition (fall, spring, and summer).
In order to be eligible for the waiver, you must:

Have resided in the Western (American) Hemisphere for a period of at least five years.
Not be a member of the Communist Party.
Not have applied for Permanent Resident status in the US, or have dual citizenship that includes the U.S.
Be enrolled in a UT Dallas program and maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a UT Dallas degree.
Be a bona fide native-born citizen and resident of an eligible country.

Additionally, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA, and graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
The Good Neighbor Scholarship Committee, coordinated by the International Center (IC), will review applications and endorse candidacies to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The Coordinating Board will select the recipients and notify the ISSO, which in turn will notify any student recipients. Applications must be submitted to the ISSO by the applicable deadline.
