The purpose of this program is to provide a waiver of nonresident tuition for the spouse and/or dependent child of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States (including the Public Health Service), who is not currently assigned to duty in Texas but has previously resided in Texas for at least a six-month period.
For the spouse or dependent children to qualify, the service member must, at least one year preceding the first day of the term or semester for which the spouse or child enrolls:

Have filed proper documentation with the military or Public Health Service to change his or her permanent residence to Texas and designated Texas as his or her place of legal residence for income tax purposes.
Have registered to vote in Texas.
Be able to show that one of the following three things has been in effect for the full 12 months prior to the first day of the relevant term or semester:

Ownership of real estate in Texas with no delinquent property taxes
Registration of an automobile in Texas
Execution of a currently-valid will that indicates he or she is a resident of Texas that has been deposited with a county clerk in Texas.

This program permits nonresident students to pay tuition and fees at the resident rate. Contact the Veterans Benefits Team to begin the application process. You must provide proof that you meet the program eligibility requirements.
