The purpose of this program is to encourage senior citizens to continue their education and keep involved with local colleges and universities.
In order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:

Be a Texas resident, nonresident, or foreign student.
Enroll in a class that is not already filled with students who are paying full price for the course (if the class is too small to accommodate both regular students and senior citizens, the regular students must be given priority).
Enroll in classes for which UT Dallas receives tax support (i.e., a course that does not depend solely on student tuition and fees to cover its costs).

Additionally, undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA and must not be subject to the fee for excessive hours, as determined by the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA.
You may be exempted from tuition for up to six semester credit hours each semester or summer term if space is available. The award does not cover fees charged for the classes. It only covers tuition. No funds may be used to pay tuition for continuing education classes for which UT Dallas receives no state tax support.
Provide proof of eligibility, such as a state-issued identification card, to the Office of Financial Aid to apply for the program.
