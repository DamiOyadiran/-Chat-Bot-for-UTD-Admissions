The purpose of this program is to encourage persons employed as peace officers to take courses designed to help them in their work. Tuition and laboratory fees for courses offered as part of a law enforcement-related or criminal justice curriculum that pertain to the major requirements of the identified programs are eligible for reimbursement. Courses not directly related to law enforcement or criminal justice are not eligible for reimbursement even though they may be required for completion of the certificate or degree. No funds may be used to pay tuition for continuing education courses for which UT Dallas receives no state tax support.
In order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:

Be employed as a peace officer by the state of Texas or by a political subdivision of Texas.
Be enrolled as an undergraduate in an undergraduate program, including certificate, associate and baccalaureate degrees leading to a law enforcement-related or criminal justice certificate or degree.
Enroll in classes for which UT Dallas receives tax support (i.e., a course that does not depend solely on student tuition and fees to cover its costs).
Meet the UT Dallas Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy.
Apply for the exemption at least one week before the last date of the University’s regular registration period for the applicable term.
Not be subject to the fee for excessive hours.

Provide the Office of Financial Aid with proof of employment as a paid peace officer and enroll in the courses of a law enforcement or criminal justice curriculum in order to apply.
