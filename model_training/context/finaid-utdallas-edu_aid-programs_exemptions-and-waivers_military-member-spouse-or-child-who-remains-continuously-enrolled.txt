The purpose of this program is to provide a waiver of nonresident tuition for members of the U.S. Armed Forces or commissioned officers in the U.S. Public Health Service, their spouse, or child.
In order to be eligible for this waiver, you must:

Be or have been a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or a commissioned officer of the U.S. Public Health Service and/or be the spouse or child of such a person.
Have been eligible to pay tuition at the resident rate while enrolled in a degree or certificate program at a Texas public college or university in spring 2003 or summer 2003 (or any semester thereafter).

Individuals are not required to enroll in a summer term to meet the “continuous enrollment” requirement.

This program permits nonresident students to pay tuition and fees at the resident rate. Contact the Veterans Benefits Team to begin the application process.
