The purpose of this program is to provide a continuation of the waiver of nonresident tuition for the spouse and/or dependent children of military personnel who remain in Texas when the military member is reassigned to duty outside the state.
This program permits nonresident students to pay tuition and fees at the resident rate. Contact the Veterans Benefits Team to begin the application process.
