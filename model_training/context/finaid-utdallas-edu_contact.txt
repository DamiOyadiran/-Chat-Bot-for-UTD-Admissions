The Office of Financial Aid is here to assist you as you navigate the financial aid process. Many of your answers are available on our website (including our chatbot), but you may still want to contact someone in our office. Questions regarding tuition, student accounts, and refunds can be answered by the Bursar Office. The Bursar Office contact information can be found on that office’s website.
