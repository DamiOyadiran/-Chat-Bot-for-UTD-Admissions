The purpose of the program is to provide an award to students who graduated at the top of their class in high school. The exemption covers tuition during both semesters of your first academic year immediately following your high school graduation. This exemption may be granted for any one of the first four regular sessions following your graduation from high school when, in the opinion of the institution’s president, the circumstances of an individual case, including military service, merit the action. Fees are not covered. No funds may be used to pay tuition for continuing education courses for which UT Dallas receives no state tax support.
In order to be eligible for the exemption, you must:

Be a Texas resident, nonresident, or foreign student.
Graduate from an accredited high school in the state of Texas.
Graduate with the highest ranking in your high school class.
Maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA.

You must provide a copy of the certificate received from your high school confirming your highest ranking to the Office of Financial Aid to begin the process of receiving the exemption.
