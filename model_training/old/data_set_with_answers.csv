maintaining-aid,maintaining-aid 1,"In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, you should apply for financial aid on an annual basis using the application that is right for you. We recommend that you meet our application deadline in order to be considered for certain financial aid and so that you receive an aid offer sooner than later.
A basic eligibility requirement for financial aid is that you meet the Office of Financial Aid’s satisfactory academic progress standards each term you intend to receive financial aid. Please note that withdrawing from class may adversely affect your eligibility for financial aid.
Certain federal student aid programs, such as the Pell Grant and Direct Stafford Loan programs, have annual and lifetime limits that we must take into account before making you a financial aid offer. Some state and institutional aid programs allow you to receive aid from that program for a certain length of time, provided you meet the program-specific eligibility criteria on both a semester and annual basis.
We encourage you to become familiar with the aid programs that are funding your education, as each program is different and may come with certain limitations and requirements.

maintaining-aid,maintaining-aid satisfactory-academic-progress 1,"To be eligible for financial aid, students must make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) based on a qualitative (GPA) and quantitative (completion rate/maximum timeframe) standard. 
Grade Point Average (GPA)

The minimum cumulative GPA requirement for undergraduate students is 2.0.
The minimum cumulative GPA requirement for graduate students is 3.0.

Maximum Time Frame

The undergraduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 125 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.
The graduate student maximum time frame for degree completion is 150 percent of the hours required to complete the degree program.

Completion Rate
Students must successfully complete a percentage of all attempted hours that is in line with completing their degree requirements within the overall maximum time frame for a degree program. This is called a pace rate requirement and is evaluated each term. This is calculated by dividing the student’s overall successfully completed hours by the student’s overall attempted hours.
The undergraduate student pace rate requirement is graduated by overall attempted hour ranges. See the following chart.
Undergraduate Pace Rate:
Attempted Hours:Required Completion Rate:0-5850%59-8860%89-12770%128 and above80%
The graduate student pace rate requirement is a two-thirds completion rate.
Incompletes (I), failing grades (F), and academic/non-academic withdrawals (W, WP, WF) count as hours attempted but not completed.
Transfer credit (including dual credits and AP credits) applied toward a student’s program counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Transfer credit hours accepted by UT Dallas as credit are counted as attempted and completed hours in the pace rate calculation. A student’s transfer grade point average does not count toward the UT Dallas term or cumulative GPA.
Repeated courses count as attempted hours. The grade from the first attempt will not be used in computing a student’s GPA. All further repeats will be used in computing the student’s cumulative GPA.
Students must meet both the qualitative and quantitative requirements to remain in good standing. It is expected that students be continually aware of their progress. Academic progress will be reviewed at the end of each term. All terms will be reviewed, including those for which financial aid was not requested.
Failure to Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards
In these provisions, warning, suspension, or probation refers only to financial aid standards of academic progress. Notices of financial aid warning, suspension, and probation will be sent via email to students’ UT Dallas email address.
Student records will be reviewed at the end of each term. The first time a student fails to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate required for the standards of academic progress, he or she will be placed on a financial aid warning status for the next term of enrollment. While financial aid will be provided for students in a warning status, the student must make satisfactory progress to remain eligible for aid. A student on warning status who fails to meet the standards of academic progress will be placed on suspension for the next term of enrollment and will not be eligible for financial aid. 
Students on financial aid suspension due to their failure to meet the minimum GPA or completion rate requirements may qualify for reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility by meeting the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy for financial aid in the next or a future term.  A student who successfully meets the requirements for reinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and will be eligible to receive financial aid for the probation term. Two consecutive terms of meeting the standards of academic progress will place the student back in good standing.  A student who has reached or exceeded his or her maximum time-frame will be placed on suspension and is not eligible for additional financial aid.
Please note that, as of fall 2014, per the Texas Education Code, Sections 54.2001 and 54.2002, in order to continue to qualify for certain state exemptions and/or waivers, students must maintain a minimum grade point average.

maintaining-aid,maintaining-aid withdrawal-policy 1,"Students who withdraw from UT Dallas or drop all courses during a semester
If you are considering dropping from or withdrawing from all your classes during a semester, it is important that you are aware of the University’s refund policies. This decision will likely impact your eligibility for financial aid that has been awarded and disbursed to your account in the Bursar’s Office. It will also likely impact your eligibility for financial aid in future semesters.
The federal government, through laws passed by Congress and regulations issued by the United States Department of Education, determines how much financial aid students may retain when they withdraw from all their classes in a semester.
A calculation, using a formula provided by the federal government, must be performed for students who receive Title IV financial assistance (Pell, FSEOG, and Direct Loans) and officially withdraw from all courses, drop all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60 percent date of the semester. All unearned aid must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the formula.
In order to keep all the financial aid issued in each semester, students must remain enrolled for more than 60 percent of the semester. After this point the student has earned 100 percent of the Title IV funds released for the semester. It is in your best interest to maintain attendance and complete at least one class each semester that you receive federal aid to avoid repayment of funds. (Different requirements apply to maintain satisfactory academic progress.)
The Return of Title IV calculation determines how much of the federal financial aid a student received for the semester was actually “earned” and how much must be repaid. The amount of financial aid earned is based on the student’s date of withdrawal from all classes.
How the calculation works:

Number of days attended ÷ Days in semester = percent of semester completed
Total $ disbursed X percent completed = Earned $
Total $ disbursed – Earned $ = $ to be returned

Students who drop courses but still are enrolled
Each federal, state, and institutional financial aid program has requirements for enrollment. The Office of Financial Aid monitors your enrollment throughout the semester.
Adjustments to financial aid awarded for the semester will be done to reflect the number of credit hours for which a student is enrolled as of the full-term session Census Day. Please refer to the Academic Calendar for the specific dates.
Students who drop classes during registration, late registration, and through the close of business on Census Day may need to return any financial aid disbursed based on their original financial aid award.
Students who fail all courses
If you fail to earn a passing grade in all courses attempted for the semester, the Office of Financial Aid is required to determine if you actually attended your classes and failed to meet course objectives, or if by ceasing to attend your courses, you unofficially withdrew from the University. In this situation, the Office of Financial Aid will use information provided by your course instructors to determine the date of your last documented participation in an academically related activity. In the event your participation is confirmed without your final date of participation, the Office of Financial aid is required to use the 50 percent point of the semester as your last date of attendance in the Return of title IV Calculation.
Other information regarding withdrawing from classes
These regulations are not the same as the University’s refund schedule which is found on the second page of the semester’s Academic Calendar.
